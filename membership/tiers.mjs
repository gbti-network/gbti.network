// sow-185 phase 1: the membership TIER axis. Node-free and dependency-free (the Worker imports this), pure over
// injected inputs, and fail-closed by construction.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Before sow-185 the system had no tier dimension at all: deriveStatus returns `paid` for ANY
// active subscription and never inspects which price was bought, and checkout carries a single STRIPE_PRICE_ID.
// Every gate downstream (classify-pr publish rights, the 14 authorizePaid routes, reconcile) keys off that one
// boolean. The moment a second, cheaper price exists in Stripe, every subscriber to it silently receives full
// Content Creator rights. That is a fail-OPEN in a codebase whose stated invariant is fail-closed, so the tier
// axis must exist and be enforced BEFORE any second price is created.
//
// THE ORDERING IS THE POINT: tiers are a total order (none < member < creator), so a gate declares the MINIMUM
// tier it needs and `meetsTier` answers. Adding a tier later means inserting a rank, not revisiting every gate.

 * production. Once buildPriceTierMap has a legacy price id to seed". That was false. The GitHub Actions env
 * seeded nothing, not even the legacy id, so `pr-membership-gate.yml` built an EMPTY map and this branch
 * resolved EVERY paid subscriber to `creator`. The sow-185 publish gate therefore admitted a $5 Network
 * Member as a Content Creator, live, for as long as both existed.
 *
 * A second door led to the same place: a caller passing a plain OBJECT where a Map belongs was silently
 * coerced to an empty Map and got `creator` too. Every price map here is BUILT from an object literal, so
 * that is the natural mistake, it looks correct at the call site, and it produced the highest privilege.
 *
 * A test named "a non-Map passed where a map belongs does not throw and DOES NOT GRANT" asserted this
 * returned `creator`, with a comment rationalising it as defensive. The alternative was never a crash: it was
 * `none`, which the adjacent test already asserts for every other malformed input. The intent was written
 * down correctly and the code never matched it. Deleting the branch makes that test name true.
 *
 * This now agrees with the rest of the feature: classify-pr `decide()` defaults `tier = TIER.none`, and the
 * syndication adapters collapse ambiguity to the restricted side. Absent must mean LESS privilege here.
