// sow-218: which managed Discord role an effective membership status should hold. Node-free and
// dependency-free, because BOTH the reconcile script and the signup Worker need it and they had no shared
// place to read it from.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The rule lived only in scripts/lib/reconcile-plan.mjs, which the Worker cannot import
// (it reaches membership/overrides.mjs, which touches the filesystem). So the Worker did not consult the rule
// at all: workers/signup/signup.mjs assigned ONE hardcoded role to every member who linked Discord, and
// reconcile silently corrected it on the next daily run.
//
// That is exactly the drift the `9363229` change tried to close and made worse. It swapped signup's hardcoded
// trial role for a hardcoded LOCKED role, which is right for a fresh free signup and wrong for everyone else:
// a paying subscriber, any grandfathered member, a superadmin, and a Codeable coupon invitee all linked
// Discord and were handed Locked. Since a coupon grant is folded into house/grandfathered.yml AFTER roles are
// computed in the same reconcile run, an invitee waited up to two daily cycles to be corrected.
//
// A hardcoded role at one call site can only ever be right for one kind of member. Sharing the rule is the fix;
// keeping the ORDER in one place is the point, exactly as membership/tiers.mjs owns the tier ordering.
