// The owner-facing "new digest subscriber" notice. One PURE helper, node-free (no fetch, no KV), so the copy is
// unit-tested without a network. Mirrors membership/coupon-notify.mjs.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner asked to be told when a new subscriber joins the weekly digest. With double opt-in
// off (`optin.double` in house/digest-config.yml, the default since sow-270) a subscriber becomes active at
// submit; with it on, at confirm. Either
// way the Worker fires this notice ONCE per genuinely new active subscriber (never on an idempotent re-subscribe).
//
// The address goes to the OWNER'S OWN inbox (the data controller), which is why it is included in full: it lets
// the owner spot a junk or third-party signup. When the address cannot be recovered (a confirm-path decrypt that
// fails), the notice still sends with the address omitted, because "a subscriber joined" is the useful signal.
