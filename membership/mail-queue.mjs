// SOW-166: the PURE mail send-pacing core for the weekly digest. No IO, no Date.now() inside (callers inject
// `now`), so it is fully unit-tested with fakes. It is the deliberate twin of membership/syndication-queue.mjs:
// the digest reuses the same claim-before-send, per-recipient sent-marker, and attempts-cap discipline the
// syndication drain already runs in production, so the two share one mental model. The Worker drain
// (workers/signup/mail-drain.mjs) does the KV read-modify-write around these transforms and the Resend send.
//
// One record is one RECIPIENT'S delivery of one ISSUE, keyed `mail:send:<issueId>:<recipientHash>`. The record
// is KV-only runtime state, never committed to git. It deliberately carries NO email address and NO issue body:
// only the issueId, the recipientHash (an HMAC of the lowercased address under a standing Worker secret, computed
// by the caller, never reversible here), and the Stripe customerId the drain resolves the address from at send
// time. So the send-state store can never leak a subscriber's raw email (data-protection.md:49 stands unamended:
// the platform stores no raw email of its own; the address only ever lives on Stripe), and the leak-guard test
// asserts a stored record serializes without any '@'.
//
// Shape (mail:send:<issueId>:<recipientHash>):
//   { issueId, recipientHash, customerId, order, status, enqueuedAt, availableAt, claimedAt, attempts,
//     sentAt, failedAt }
//
// The per-recipient-per-issue KEY is itself the idempotency guarantee: one recipient can hold at most one record
// per issue, so a re-run of the weekly compile finds the record already present and does not enqueue a second.
