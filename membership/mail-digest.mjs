// SOW-166: the PURE digest composition core for the weekly newsletter. No IO, no Date.now() inside (callers
// inject `now`), so it is fully unit-tested with fakes. The Worker's weekly compile cron gathers the inputs
// (the public activity build-artifact over HTTP, plus the SOW-111 news-open counts from KV), normalizes them
// to the item shapes below, and calls composeIssue ONCE to freeze one issue (`mail:issue:<issueId>`); every
// recipient's email then renders from that single frozen object, so the newsletter has a stable archive and a
// stable permalink (Q12: compile once).
//
// THE LEAK GUARD IS STRUCTURAL, not a filter a caller can forget. Two layers:
//   1. Any member item is EXCLUDED: an item is kept only if visibility === 'public'. Missing/other -> dropped
//      (fail closed), matching src/lib/home-feed.mjs isPublicShare and the activity-index Mode B stubs.
//   2. Even a public item is copied field-by-field into a PUBLIC-SAFE projection (kind/title/url/author/
//      authorName/date only). There is deliberately no body/encryptedBody field, so a caller that wrongly
//      passes a member body cannot leak it into a compiled issue (the leak-guard test asserts this).
//
// THE WINDOW IS PART OF THE SECTION CONTRACT, not an optimization. `since` drops member items older than the
// previous issue, and WITHOUT it the whole contract is silently hollow: the input artifacts are the site's
// entire published history (activity-index.json filters on isListed only and caps at 40 PER TYPE;
// shares-index filters on isPublicShare only), so an unwindowed compile emits the newest 5 of each type ever
// published, and emits the SAME 5 again next week. Every empty-section note below then becomes unreachable
// code, because a section on a site with five published articles is never empty again, and `maxNewsThin`
// dies with it (it triggers on memberItemCount === 0). The owner's empty-section ruling presupposes a window:
// a note renders "because a visible gap is an invitation to fill it", and there is no gap without a window.
//
// `since` AND `exclude` ARE TWO REGIMES, NOT TWO FILTERS TO STACK. `since` windows on publishedAt, which is
// only a PROXY for "new to the reader": publishedAt is stamped in the client when the PR is OPENED
// (client/src/operations.mjs), while the item reaches activity-index.json only after merge plus deploy. An item
// whose publishedAt predates the last compile but which first became visible AFTER it is dropped by `since` and
// never mailed at all: a held contribution PR, or a deliberately backdated date. `exclude` is the real semantic,
// the set of urls already mailed, and it cannot lose an item that way.
//
// CORRECTED 2026-08-21, same day, and the first version of this note caused a live defect. It said to pass ONE
// of them per issue and never both, and the orchestrator implemented exactly that: `since = null` from issue two
// onward. With no floor the pool is the WHOLE artifact, so issue two mails the pre-newsletter back catalogue as
// if it were this week's news, ordered newest-unmailed-first so it walks backwards in time week by week, and the
// empty-section notes are unreachable again for as long as the archive takes to drain. That is the same
// hollowing-out the window was added to fix, arrived at from the other side.
//
// THEY ARE A FILTER AND A FLOOR, AND THE FLOOR IS NOT OPTIONAL:
//   FIRST ISSUE   since = now - 7d,             exclude = null          bounds the launch issue
//   THEREAFTER    since = the newsletter EPOCH, exclude = mailed urls   everything unmailed since it began
//
// The epoch is the first issue's own `window.since`, already recorded on that frozen issue, so it needs no new
// constant and nothing to tune. It means the newsletter covers its own lifetime and never its pre-history: an
// item published before the newsletter existed is never mailed, and an item published since is mailed exactly
// once however late it arrives. What re-opens the loss is stacking `exclude` with a TIGHT `since` (a per-issue
// window), not with a floor: a floor months in the past cannot cut off a contribution held for review for days.
//
// The one case the floor does exclude is an item published BEFORE the first issue and merged after it. That is a
// launch-boundary case, it happens once, and treating a newsletter's second issue as not carrying things from
// before it existed is the right reading of it rather than a loss.
//
// The frozen issue records both, so which regime produced it is readable rather than inferred.
//

//   { kind: 'article'|'product'|'prompt'|'share', title, url, author, authorName?, date: number,

// not. The owner chose this over skipping silently, which was the other recommendation on the table.
//
// ORDER is "the types that have content first, news especially". SECTION_ORDER is the canonical priority,
// and `layout` splits on it: filled sections in that order, then empty sections in that SAME order. So the

 * The flag stays because the template and the logs still want to know.
 *
 * `since` is the member-content window: items older than it are dropped before grouping (see the header note,
 * where the reason it is load-bearing lives). Absent means no window, which is what every caller written before
 * this option got, and it is never the right thing for the weekly compile.
 *
 * `firstIssue` swaps the empty-section notes for their launch wording and attaches `launchNote`. Only ever
 * true once, and the caller already knows it: it is the same condition that made `resolveSince` bootstrap.
 *
 * `exclude` is the set of urls already mailed, and it is the semantic `since` only approximates. From issue two
 * onward pass BOTH: `exclude` is the filter and `since` is the newsletter's epoch floor. `exclude` alone mails
 * the pre-newsletter back catalogue; a PER-ISSUE `since` alongside it re-opens the loss `exclude` closes. See
 * the header note, which said the wrong thing first and explains why.
 *
 * `maxNewsThin` OPTIONALLY lifts the news cap on a week with NO member content, so a news-led issue is a
 * real issue rather than a stub. It applies only when every member section is empty, it can only raise the
 * cap and never lower it, and it defaults to no lift, so an explicit maxNews is always a real ceiling. The
