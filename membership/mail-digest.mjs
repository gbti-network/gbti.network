// SOW-166: the PURE digest composition core for the weekly newsletter. No IO, no Date.now() inside (callers
// inject `now`), so it is fully unit-tested with fakes. The Worker's weekly compile cron gathers the inputs
// (the public activity build-artifact over HTTP, plus the SOW-111 news-open counts from KV), normalizes them
// to the item shapes below, and calls composeIssue ONCE to freeze one issue (`mail:issue:<issueId>`); every
// recipient's email then renders from that single frozen object, so the newsletter has a stable archive and a
// stable permalink (Q12: compile once).
//
// THE LEAK GUARD IS STRUCTURAL, not a filter a caller can forget. Two layers:
//   1. Any member item is EXCLUDED: an item is kept only if visibility === 'public'. Missing/other -> dropped
//      (fail closed), matching src/lib/home-feed.mjs isPublicShare and the activity-index Mode B stubs.
//   2. Even a public item is copied field-by-field into a PUBLIC-SAFE projection (kind/title/url/author/
//      authorName/date, plus blurb/thumb since 2026-08-23). There is deliberately no body/encryptedBody
//      field, so a caller that wrongly passes a member body cannot leak it into a compiled issue (the
//      leak-guard test asserts this). `blurb` is public frontmatter ONLY and has NO body fallback; see the
//      note on publicItem for why the rule, rather than the field name, is the control.
//
// THE WINDOW IS PART OF THE SECTION CONTRACT, not an optimization. `since` drops member items older than the
// previous issue, and WITHOUT it the whole contract is silently hollow: the input artifacts are the site's
// entire published history (activity-index.json filters on isListed only and caps at 40 PER TYPE;
// shares-index filters on isPublicShare only), so an unwindowed compile emits the newest 5 of each type ever
// published, and emits the SAME 5 again next week. Every empty-section note below then becomes unreachable
// code, because a section on a site with five published articles is never empty again, and `maxNewsThin`
// dies with it (it triggers on memberItemCount === 0). The owner's empty-section ruling presupposes a window:
// a note renders "because a visible gap is an invitation to fill it", and there is no gap without a window.
//
// `since` AND `exclude` ARE TWO REGIMES, NOT TWO FILTERS TO STACK. `since` windows on publishedAt, which is
// only a PROXY for "new to the reader": publishedAt is stamped in the client when the PR is OPENED
// (client/src/operations.mjs), while the item reaches activity-index.json only after merge plus deploy. An item
// whose publishedAt predates the last compile but which first became visible AFTER it is dropped by `since` and
// never mailed at all: a held contribution PR, or a deliberately backdated date. `exclude` is the real semantic,
// the set of urls already mailed, and it cannot lose an item that way.
//
// CORRECTED 2026-08-21, same day, and the first version of this note caused a live defect. It said to pass ONE
// of them per issue and never both, and the orchestrator implemented exactly that: `since = null` from issue two
// onward. With no floor the pool is the WHOLE artifact, so issue two mails the pre-newsletter back catalogue as
// if it were this week's news, ordered newest-unmailed-first so it walks backwards in time week by week, and the
// empty-section notes are unreachable again for as long as the archive takes to drain. That is the same
// hollowing-out the window was added to fix, arrived at from the other side.
//
// THEY ARE A FILTER AND A FLOOR, AND THE FLOOR IS NOT OPTIONAL:
//   FIRST ISSUE   since = now - 7d,             exclude = null          bounds the launch issue
//   THEREAFTER    since = the newsletter EPOCH, exclude = mailed urls   everything unmailed since it began
//
// The epoch is the first issue's own `window.since`, already recorded on that frozen issue, so it needs no new
// constant and nothing to tune. It means the newsletter covers its own lifetime and never its pre-history: an
// item published before the newsletter existed is never mailed, and an item published since is mailed exactly
// once however late it arrives. What re-opens the loss is stacking `exclude` with a TIGHT `since` (a per-issue
// window), not with a floor: a floor months in the past cannot cut off a contribution held for review for days.
//
// The one case the floor does exclude is an item published BEFORE the first issue and merged after it. That is a
// launch-boundary case, it happens once, and treating a newsletter's second issue as not carrying things from
// before it existed is the right reading of it rather than a loss.
//
// The frozen issue records both, so which regime produced it is readable rather than inferred.
//
// SUPERSEDED IN PART, sow-297, 2026-08-31 (owner ruling). Everything above stays true about `since` and
// `exclude`, and both are still passed. What changed is that the weekly is no longer "everything unmailed
// since the newsletter began": the owner ruled it covers ONE WEEK, so a reader opening it sees this week and
// not a slowly draining archive. The archive is not lost, it is the WELCOME issue's job, which every new
// subscriber receives as their first email carrying 90 days.
//
// The week is measured on VISIBILITY, not on publishedAt, which is the whole reason a third input exists.
// Cutting the weekly to `since = now - 7d` would have reintroduced exactly the loss the note above describes:
// publishedAt is stamped when the PR is OPENED, so a contribution held for review for eight days is below a
// seven-day floor on the day it first becomes visible, and would never be mailed at all. So:
//
//   `seen` = every public url that was ALREADY VISIBLE at the previous issue's compile.
//
// An item is new to this issue exactly when it is not in that set. That is measured, not inferred: each frozen
// issue now records `pool`, the urls of every public, due item in the artifact at ITS compile, and next week's
// compile diffs against it. Nothing can fall through a clock boundary, a missed compile widens the window to
// cover the gap instead of dropping a week, and the wording the sections already use ("since the last issue")
// becomes literally what the filter does.
//
//   FIRST ISSUE   since = now - 90d,            exclude = null,   seen = null    bounds the launch issue
//   THEREAFTER    since = the coupled floor,    exclude = mailed, seen = last issue's pool
//
// `since` and `exclude` are KEPT alongside it rather than replaced. They are cheap, they are already proven,
// and they are the backstop for the one case `seen` cannot cover: a pool that failed to record. Narrowing is
// the safe direction here, since the cost of an over-tight week is one item arriving a week late in the next
// issue, and the cost of an over-loose one is the back-catalogue drain described above.

// live ceiling: under the weekly window it would silently drop the overflow every busy week, and a dropped
// item is dropped for good, because next week it is no longer new.

// not. The owner chose this over skipping silently, which was the other recommendation on the table.

// as unresolved precisely because nobody could tell whether the design predated the earlier ruling.
//

 * The flag stays because the template and the logs still want to know.
 *
 * `since` is the member-content window: items older than it are dropped before grouping (see the header note,
 * where the reason it is load-bearing lives). Absent means no window, which is what every caller written before
 * this option got, and it is never the right thing for the weekly compile.
 *
 * `firstIssue` swaps the empty-section notes for their launch wording and attaches `launchNote`. Only ever
 * true once, and the caller already knows it: it is the same condition that made `resolveSince` bootstrap.
 *
 * `exclude` is the set of urls already mailed, and it is the semantic `since` only approximates. From issue two
 * onward pass BOTH: `exclude` is the filter and `since` is the newsletter's epoch floor. `exclude` alone mails
 * the pre-newsletter back catalogue; a PER-ISSUE `since` alongside it re-opens the loss `exclude` closes. See
 * the header note, which said the wrong thing first and explains why.
 *
 * `seen` (sow-297) is the set of public urls that were ALREADY VISIBLE at the previous issue's compile, and it
 * is what makes the weekly a WEEK rather than the whole unmailed archive. An item is new to this issue exactly
 * when it is absent from it. Measured rather than inferred: it comes from the previous frozen issue's `pool`.
 * Absent or null means no visibility filter, which is right for a first issue and for the welcome, and which is
 * also the safe fallback the day a pool fails to record (the issue is then merely wider, never narrower).
 *
 * `perSection` is a cap per KIND: a number caps all four alike, an object caps each by name (with `default`
 * for the rest), and nothing at all means DEFAULT_SECTION_CAPS. See that constant for why shares differ.
 *
 * `maxNewsThin` OPTIONALLY lifts the news cap on a week with NO member content, so a news-led issue is a
 * real issue rather than a stub. It applies only when every member section is empty, it can only raise the
 * cap and never lower it, and it defaults to no lift, so an explicit maxNews is always a real ceiling. The

    // AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS CLAMPED THE DATE TO THE COMPILE TIME INSTEAD, AND THAT DID NOT WORK. Clamping

    // merged code forward, which is the only thing that can see it: "published no later than THIS compile" is

    // it". A perpetually-now item is structurally incompatible with a lagging floor.

    // date passes, mails once, and is then below every later floor. The failure direction is right too: a
