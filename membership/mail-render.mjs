// SOW-166: renderIssue v2, the SEND-READY table template behind the injected `renderIssue` seam. Built from the
// owner's design handoff (`.data/sow/1_progressing/cf-server/sow-166-assets/`), reconciled to our systems by the
// owner's 2026-08-21 rulings: it ships the design's skeleton, typography and visual language, and takes its
// facts, ordering and fields from the composition core, never from the mockup. Two 600px table-based palettes
// share one skeleton; this renders the LIGHT variant by default (the design's own note calls it safest across
// inboxes, and prefers-color-scheme is unreliable in email, so the dark/light choice is a PICK via `ctx.theme`,
// not a both). No JavaScript, no web fonts, all inline styles: static table HTML plus a plain-text alternative.
//
// PURE and node-free. It reads only the frozen issue (layout, counts, generatedAt, launchNote) and the injected
// ctx, calls no Date.now (it formats the FROZEN generatedAt in UTC, deterministic), and returns
// { subject, html, text }. Ordering, the filled-before-empty split, and the empty-section copy are decided once
// in the composition core (membership/mail-digest.mjs buildLayout) and never re-derived here.
//
// WHAT RENDERS FROM ABSENT DATA, NEVER A PLACEHOLDER (each is gated upstream, so the row degrades rather than
// inventing content that could ship wrong):
//   - blurb: an OPTIONAL item field carrying the item's PUBLIC frontmatter excerpt / shortDescription. The
//     renderer reads `it.blurb` and NOTHING ELSE: it NEVER falls back to `it.body` or any ciphertext. That
//     no-fallback behaviour is the security control, not a nicety, and a test pins it (an item with a body and
//     no blurb renders an empty row). The composition projection is public-safe by construction and carries no
//     body field at all; this keeps the guard true even if a caller hand-builds an item.
//   - thumb: an OPTIONAL item field (already present in activity-index.json). Rendered through safeUrl, so an
//     unsafe value drops to no image. Absent means a single-column row.
//   - avatar: DERIVED from `it.author` (github.com/<login>.png), so it needs no new field. Decorative, empty
//     alt, and images are blocked by default in email, so a wrong or missing login shows nothing, never a
//     broken label.
//   - NO Sponsored card and NO standalone Plans card (owner ruling: dropped from this template).
//   - NO greeting personalisation beyond the design's `simple` default (a first name is stored nowhere).
//   - postal address: rendered ONLY from ctx.postalAddress, and ONLY when the drain supplies it (the CAN-SPAM
//     7704(a)(5) footer slot). There is no default and nothing hardcoded: absent ctx renders no address at all,
//     which is the permanent contract that keeps the value off the default render path. OWNER 2026-08-21: the
//     digest ships with NO postal address for now (the primary-purpose position, .data/ops/mail-ops/), and a
//     PO Box is a LATER intent. So this inert ctx.postalAddress slot is now LOAD-BEARING, not defensive: when
//     the PO Box exists it becomes a MAIL_POSTAL_ADDRESS Worker secret the drain reads and passes in ctx, a
//     config change, NOT a code change here. It must NEVER reach a committed file: the content repo is public,
//     so a street address in git history is a permanent, forkable, crawlable exposure that an email to a
//     subscriber is not. For that reason the test fixture is an obviously fake address, and the real value
//     appears in no comment, doc, or commit message.
//
// UNSUBSCRIBE. `ctx.unsubscribeUrl` is per-recipient and arrives from the drain at send time; the renderer mints
// no token. With a real url the footer carries a one-click Unsubscribe link. WITHOUT one it renders a
// managed-subscription prose line with NO link. That prose branch is NOT a supported degraded SEND mode: an
// email with no working opt-out must never be sent, and enforcing that is owed to the drain, which MUST refuse a
// recipient with no unsubscribeUrl rather than render this branch. The branch exists for the public web archive
// (a permalink issue is not a mailed message and needs no opt-out), and as a fail-safe that shows no dead link.
// It sets NO email headers: List-Unsubscribe and the multipart assembly are the sendEmail wrapper's job.

// The masthead: the week on the right, the logo to the right of it, and nothing on the left.
//
// OWNER RULING, 2026-08-24: the "GBTI Digest" wordmark is gone from the top left and the logo takes the
// corner. The identity is carried by the mark and by the greeting directly beneath it, so the wordmark was
// saying the same thing a third time.
//
// THE MARK IS THEMED, because it is a solid silhouette with no contrast of its own: the ink mark disappears
// on the dark card and the white mark disappears on the light one. It is picked from the same `theme` that
// picks the palette, so the two cannot disagree.
//
// IMAGES ARE OFF BY DEFAULT IN MANY INBOXES, which is why the mark is an addition to the week rather than a
// replacement for the wordmark's job. With images blocked the reader still sees the week, the alt text and
// the greeting; nothing that identifies the sender depends on a fetch succeeding.
