// undefined and empty a whole section with no error. This module NEVER decides public-vs-member; it preserves
// the field and lets composeIssue's single guard decide. That keeps ONE leak guard, not two that can disagree.
//
// It carries NO body or ciphertext: it copies kind/title/url/author/authorName/date/visibility only, so there
// is no field here that could move gated content into the compiled issue.

// activity-index.json uses `type` (post/product/prompt); shares-index.json uses `type: 'share'`. composeIssue

 *      email somebody's introduction to the network, which is exactly what this feature exists to prevent.

 *      sending the weekly too would put two overlapping issues in their inbox days apart. They join the normal
 *      cadence at the next one (owner ruling, 2026-08-23).
 *
 * ON THE FIRST WEEKLY THERE IS NO PRIOR ISSUE, AND THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS FUNCTION LET EVERYBODY
 * THROUGH. Its reasoning was that with no prior weekly there is no cycle to double up with. That is wrong,
 * and it is wrong in the one case it was reached: on launch day the welcome sweep and the first weekly both
 * fire, so the thing to double up with is not the previous ISSUE, it is the subscriber's own WELCOME.
 * It cost a real double send on 2026-08-24. A subscriber was welcomed at 13:50:26Z and received the first
 * weekly at 14:05:26Z, fifteen minutes later, both carrying the same 90 days. Confirmed from the stored
 * `mail:send:` records, not from a log line.
 * So the floor falls back to the issue's OWN window start. On a first issue that is the 90-day bootstrap
 * edge, which is exactly the span the welcome covered, so anyone welcomed inside it is correctly excluded.
 * The first weekly may then have no eligible recipients at all, and that is the right answer rather than a
 * degenerate one: everybody who would have received it has already been sent the same content.
