// sow-185 phase 3a: resolve a member's effective TIER for the publish gates, and build the price -> tier map
// from the Worker / CI env. PURE, node-free, Worker+CI-safe (like membership/tiers.mjs and checkout-prices.mjs).
//
// The STATUS axis (paid / trialing / banned / ...) is resolved by membership/overrides-core.mjs effectiveStatus,
// which folds ban > staff > grandfather > Stripe. This module adds ONLY the tier axis, and it resolves the tier
// from that SAME effectiveStatus { status, source } so the overrides are never dropped. An account paid via an
// OVERRIDE (grandfather or staff) has no Stripe subscription, so a Stripe-only resolver (deriveMembership) would
// give it tier none and the creator gate would wrongly deny a grandfathered comp member or a superadmin. Reading
// the source closes that hole. Fail closed to TIER.none everywhere.

// (free = no grant; deplatform = a ban). Shared with scripts/validate-content.mjs.

/**
 * Build the priceId -> tier Map that tiers.mjs tierForPrice / deriveMembership consume, from the injected env.

 * seeded as MEMBER (via buildPriceTierMap; owner ruling 2026-09-02). Reuses checkout-prices PRICE_ENV so the naming has one
 * source. An empty env yields an empty map, and since 2026-08-11 tierForPrice FAILS CLOSED on that: every
 * price resolves to `none` rather than to creator. An unprovisioned env therefore grants no tier at all,
 * which is the safe direction; it used to grant the highest one.

 * tier (every legacy flat grant) or an unrecognized one defaults to MEMBER. The owner flipped this default from
 * creator to member on 2026-08-18 (owner-questions.md Q15), with the consequence stated in the chosen option:
 * the fifteen tierless co-op comps drop to Network Member. They keep everything already published (only a ban
 * drafts content), but classify-pr rejects their next content PR as rejected-not-creator and reconcile drops
 * their Content Creator Discord badge. The escape hatch is an explicit `tier: creator` on any single entry, so
 * anyone who should keep full access is restored by hand without reversing the default.
