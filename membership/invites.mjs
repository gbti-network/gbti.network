// sow-231: the ISSUED INVITE core. A campaign (house/coupons.yml) says WHAT an invite is worth; an invite
// says WHO we handed one to. This module is the pure half: minting a unique code, building the record, and
// deciding whether a given record may still be redeemed. Node-free (no fs, no yaml, no crypto), so the
// Worker, the CI validator and the tests all share one implementation.
//
// WHY THESE LIVE IN KV AND NOT IN house/coupons.yml, since that is the surprising part:
// an issued invite is a record of who we sent something to, carrying an administration note that in
// practice names a person. That is private, mutable, per-person state, and CLAUDE.md's storage boundary
// puts it in KV. Minting unique codes into the registry would write person-keyed records into a public,
// forkable, CDN-cached repository permanently, open one pull request per invite, and make the note the most
// identifying field in git history. The campaign stays in git because it is curated configuration; the
// invites do not because they are about people.
//
// THE BEARER PROPERTY IS ACCEPTED, NOT DENIED (owner, 2026-08-12, reversing their own 2026-07-18 ruling).
// Whoever opens a one-time link first can redeem it, so a forwarded link is a transferred membership. That
// was weighed and accepted: the alternative in place today is a shared, uncapped, published code whose
// failure mode is the WHOLE campaign, where this one fails at a single seat. Invites are deliberately
// FIRST-COME rather than bound to a named recipient, because the coupon is validated at /signup/start
// before either OAuth hop, so a bound invite could only be REFUSED after the recipient had already
// authorized GitHub and Discord. See sow-231 open questions 1 and 2.
