// SOW-166: the PURE subscriber-record core for the weekly digest. No IO, no crypto, no Date.now() inside
// (callers inject `now`), so it is fully unit-tested with fakes. One record is one subscriber, keyed
// `mail:subscriber:<hash>` where `<hash>` is the one-way HMAC identity from mail-suppress.mjs (`mailHash`).
//
// STORE DECISION (owner, 2026-08-17): the subscriber list is SELF-MANAGED in Cloudflare KV, OFF the Stripe
// billing registry (resolving the SecurityMaster ruling), with Resend kept purely transactional. This core is
// the record shape for that store.
//
// THE ADDRESS IS NEVER STORED IN PLAINTEXT. There are two resolution paths, and a record carries exactly one:
//   - an ANONYMOUS subscriber (source 'anon') carries `emailEnc`, the address AES-256-GCM-encrypted under the
//     STANDING MAIL_EMAIL_KEY (never the rotating member-content key); the Worker decrypts it only at send time.
//   - a MEMBER subscriber (source 'member') carries `githubId` (and optionally `customerId`) and NO email: the
//     address stays on the member's Stripe Customer, so data-protection.md:49 is intact for members and the
//     drain resolves the address from Stripe at send time.
// The core takes `emailEnc` as an OPAQUE string (the encryption is the Worker's job) and has no field that
// could hold a raw address, so a compiled record can never serialize an '@' from the address (leak-guard test).
//
// Shape (mail:subscriber:<hash>):
//   { hash, source, status, emailEnc, customerId, githubId, createdAt, updatedAt, welcomedAt, digestOff }
//
// `digestOff` (sow-202, owner 2026-09-13) is the member's own "no weekly digest" choice, set from the switch on
// /account/notifications/. It is NOT an unsubscribe: the record stays active, so follow-alert mail (which needs this
// record, scripts/enqueue-notifications.mjs) keeps working, and only the digest compile skips it (wantsDigest).
//
// Unsubscribe/erasure HARD-DELETES the record (the Worker) and writes the mail-suppress marker, which outlives
// it. `status: 'unsubscribed'` exists for a caller that prefers a soft transition, but the approved design is
// hard-delete-plus-suppress.

 * Build a canonical, active subscriber record. PURE. Requires the hash and a resolvable address path: an
 * 'anon' record must carry `emailEnc`; a 'member' record must carry `githubId`. A record with no way to
 * resolve an address is useless and is rejected. `emailEnc` is opaque ciphertext; passing a raw address in
 * any other field is structurally impossible (there is no such field).
 *
 * `githubId` IS REQUIRED ON A MEMBER RECORD, AND IT IS AN ERASURE REQUIREMENT RATHER THAN A SHAPE
 * PREFERENCE. Erasure cannot resolve a member's address through Stripe when their Customer is gone or
 * carries no email, so it finds their subscriber records by scanning `mail:subscriber:*` and matching
 * `githubId`. A member record with only a `customerId` would be INVISIBLE to that scan, and nothing would
 * ever flag it: the write succeeds, the record sends mail perfectly well, and the gap surfaces only as a
 * deletion request that silently does not delete, possibly years later.
 *
 * This previously accepted `githubId` OR `customerId`. Every caller passed `githubId` anyway, so the
 * guarantee rested on three call sites happening to agree rather than on the schema, and the next person to
 * add a fourth had no way to know it was load-bearing. Tightened once it was confirmed that no caller used
 * the customerId-only branch (found by @QAmaster, routed by @SowMaster, callers re-enumerated at origin
 * before the change). `customerId` remains an OPTIONAL extra on a member record.
