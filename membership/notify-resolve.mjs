// SOW-186 phase 1 (the decision-independent leaf): the PURE notification-resolution helper. Given a member's
// global notification defaults and an optional per-follow override for one followed member, plus the event
// kind, it decides which channels fire for a single notification: { api, email }.
//
// This is the ONLY sow-186 piece built ahead of the owner's plan approval. It was built under the owner's
// 2026-08-21 instruction ("keep progressing, build whatever is decision-independent, do not sit idle waiting
// on the Q25 rulings", relayed by SowMaster) because it is decision-INVARIANT:
//   - Correct under BOTH fan-out models. Write-time fan-out and read-time derivation both call this same pure
//     function; it makes no assumption about WHEN it runs, so open question 1 (fan-out on write vs read)
//     does not change it.
//   - OQ4-safe. It is keyed by event kind, so generalising beyond author-follow to categories or replies
//     later needs no rewrite and no stored-shape migration.
//   - It persists NOTHING and delivers NOTHING, so it cannot mis-deliver.
//
// What is deliberately NOT built here, and is HELD for the owner's plan approval plus open question 4 (does
// this generalise beyond author-follow, which shapes the stored field): the per-follow `notify` field on
// `membership/member-follows.mjs`, the global-defaults field on `membership/member-prefs.mjs`, the
// notification store (sow-150's primitive, which this must consume rather than duplicate), the settings
// surface, and every delivery path. Those change LIVE store shapes and the feature's architecture; this
// leaf changes neither.
//
// Precedence per channel, highest wins:
//   per-follow override (for this event) -> global default (for this event) -> SYSTEM_NOTIFY_DEFAULT.
// Resolution is per channel, not per bag: a per-follow override that sets only `email` leaves `api` to fall
// through to the global default (and then the system default), so a partial override never silently blanks
// the channel it did not mention.

export const NOTIFY_CHANNELS = ['api', 'email'];

// Fail closed on the channel that spends money and carries CAN-SPAM weight. The in-app bell (`api`) is ON so
// that following is visibly useful, but EMAIL is OFF unless a member explicitly turns it on, so no existing
// member is ever opted into mail they did not ask for (Q25 item 4). A missing or unreadable preference
// therefore resolves to no email, never to email.
