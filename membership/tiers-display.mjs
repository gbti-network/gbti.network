/**
 * A benefit is either a bare string or `{ label, description }`, and BOTH normalize to the object form so
 * every consumer reads one shape. The string form stays valid on purpose: most surfaces (the pricing
 * accordion, the membership table) render a one-line bullet and have nothing to do with a description, so
 * requiring one everywhere would be churn for no reader.
 *
 * WHY A DESCRIPTION BELONGS HERE AND NOT ON THE PAGE THAT SHOWS IT. sow-230: a member-tier invite went live
 * advertising Creator benefits because its benefit prose was hand-written into the page and inherited from
 * the page it was copied from. The fix was to render benefits from this file, so no page types a benefit
 * sentence. A design then asked for a headline plus a supporting line per benefit, and the tempting shortcut
 * was to write those lines into the template, which would have reopened exactly that hole one field over.
 * The description is benefit copy, it is a legal line under this file's own header rule, and it lives where
 * the rest of the benefit copy is reviewed.
