// sow-273 follow-up: digest click counting, the PURE half.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The digest tags its own links with utm_source/medium/campaign/content, and on
// 2026-08-24 it was established that Cloudflare Web Analytics CANNOT read them: introspecting its GraphQL
// schema across all 38 RUM types and 1,234 field names turned up no query-string field anywhere. A URL is
// stored as host, path and scheme only. The beacon sends the whole address and the query is discarded before
// storage. So the tags are collected and thrown away, and measuring the digest needs our own counter.
//
// THE OWNER DECIDED (2026-08-24) THAT NEWS LINKS ARE COUNTED TOO, not just links back to gbti.network. That
// is the single most useful signal a curated digest produces, because it says which sources earn their
// place. It also means this route redirects to THIRD-PARTY urls, which is what makes the next paragraph the
// most important one in the file.
//
// OPEN REDIRECT IS THE WHOLE THREAT MODEL, AND IT IS CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION RATHER THAN BY FILTERING.
// A link carries an issue id, a placement, and a SLOT, which is a short hash of the destination. It does not
// carry the destination. The Worker loads the FROZEN issue, recomputes the slot for every url that issue
// legitimately contains, and redirects only to the one that matches. There is no input from which an
// arbitrary target can be constructed, so there is no filter to get wrong and no allowlist to fall behind.
// A tampered slot resolves to nothing and the reader is sent to the site root.
// The hash is therefore NOT a security primitive and does not need to be unguessable or collision-proof: an
// attacker who guesses a slot redirects a reader to another link from the same newsletter. It is a lookup
// key, so it is a plain synchronous FNV-1a, which keeps the renderer synchronous (crypto.subtle is async and
// making the whole template async to hash a string would be a poor trade).
//
// NO RECIPIENT IDENTITY IS RECORDED, EVER. Not a hash, not an address, not an IP, not a user agent. The
// counter answers "how many clicks did this placement get in this issue", which is the question worth
// asking, and refuses to be able to answer "did this person click", which is the one that turns a counter
// into surveillance and drags the whole store into a data-protection question it does not need to be in.
