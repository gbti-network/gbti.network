// A binary image must be a WEB-IMAGE file under the matched folder's images/ directory, either the flat
// per-member `images/<name>` or, since sow-203, an item's own `<type>/<slug>/images/<name>`. NO svg (an
// uploaded svg is a navigation-XSS vector when opened directly); the web upload is raster-only, the
// extension host keeps svg.
//
// The optional item segment exists because content items CO-LOCATE their images beside index.md, which is
// the layout the Astro build resolves natively (the flat per-user path could not be resolved by image() and
// broke the site build, which is why the client moved to co-location on 2026-08-04). Only this validator was
// left on the flat-only rule, so a rename that had to carry co-located images was rejected outright and the
// attempt was reverted (sow-165, 2026-08-06).
//
// Every other property is deliberately unchanged, because this pattern is one of the few things standing
// between a hosted write and an arbitrary repo path: anchored at BOTH ends, matched against the tail AFTER
// the caller's folder prefix is stripped so it stays folder-scoped, the type restricted to the three content
// subdirectories, and the slug restricted to the same charset ANY_MEMBER_FOLDER_RE uses. Neither the slug
// nor the filename class admits `/`, and the slug admits no `.` either, so no traversal is expressible.
// NO `i` FLAG, AND ITS ABSENCE IS THE POINT (sow-157, 2026-08-22). Every class here is lowercase, so the
// flag silently widened all of them and `POSTS/My-Slug/images/A.PNG` was accepted. The SECURITY properties
// held either way (no traversal, no nested depth, no double extension, no escape from the member's tree),
// which is why this survived review: the cost is correctness, and it is a silent one.
//
// On a case-sensitive filesystem an accepted `POSTS/` or `My-Slug/` writes a SECOND directory that the Astro
// build never reads. The upload returns success, the member sees a confirmation, and the image simply never
// appears. That is the worst failure shape available for a member-facing action, because nothing anywhere
// reports a fault.
//
// The extension is held to lowercase TOO, which is the part worth explaining because it looks unkind to a
// phone that produces `IMG_4021.JPG`. The web client's `sanitizeImageName` (src/lib/workbench-client-core.mjs)
// already lowercases the entire leaf before upload, and its own contract says it exists so that the client
// and this wall AGREE ON WHAT AN IMAGE FILENAME IS. If this accepted `photo.JPG` while the client would only
// ever produce `photo.jpg`, they would not agree, and the one path that reaches here uppercase is a
// non-web client, which gets a precise error telling it exactly what to change. An explicit rejection turns
// an invisible failure into a visible one; silently lowercasing here would fix the render and leave the
// member wondering why their file has a different name.
