// SOW-186 phase 4 (DELIVERY): the PURE core of follow-the-author email fan-out. No IO, no Date.now, no network,
// so the whole decision is unit-tested with plain objects. The runner (scripts/enqueue-notifications.mjs) wraps
// these with KV REST reads (the reverse follower index, each follower's follows + prefs, the subscriber scan) and
// the eager enqueue.
//
// WHY FAN-OUT AT PUBLISH, NOT IN THE DRAIN (the design that retires SowMaster's no-hoist tension by construction,
// 2026-08-22): the notification is resolved and ENQUEUED here, at publish time, into a NORMAL eager mail issue
// (mail:issue: + mail:pending: + mail:send:, via workers/signup/mail-store.mjs enqueueIssue). The existing */5
// drain then drains it byte-for-byte the same as a weekly digest, because the drain reads only issueId from the
// issue and never a kind-specific field. So the leak guard, the fail-closed send gate, the rate budget, the
// per-recipient suppression re-check, and the one-click unsubscribe are all shared with the digest not by a
// hoisted helper but because BOTH kinds flow through the one unchanged drain. Nothing on the lazy/eager fork of
// the drain is touched.
//
// LEAK GUARD (SOW-186 B3): a notification carries ONLY public metadata (author, display name, type, title, and a
// PUBLIC url). The runner gates on publicUrlFor (null for a members-only / Mode A item and for a share), so a
// gated item is never even enqueued; buildNotificationIssue below carries no body/blurb field at all, and the
// renderer reads a fixed allow-list. Three independent layers, none of which reads a body.
//
// EMAIL FAILS CLOSED: selectEmailRecipients resolves each follower through resolveNotify, whose email channel is
// OFF unless the member explicitly turned it on (membership/notify-resolve.mjs SYSTEM_NOTIFY_DEFAULT). Until the
// settings surface ships and a member opts in AND has a mailable subscriber record AND the owner opens the send
// gate AND the MAIL_* secrets are provisioned, this fan-out resolves to zero recipients and the drain sends
// nothing. That is the intended dormant state, not a bug.
