//   node scripts/mail-enroll.mjs              # dry run (the default), writes NOTHING
//   node scripts/mail-enroll.mjs --apply      # enact, and see the two gates below
//
// DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT because this writes at full population scale and the mistake only surfaces at send.
// That is the reconcile convention and it matters more here than there.
//
// TWO HARD GATES ON --apply, BOTH MECHANISMS RATHER THAN REMINDERS:
//
//   1. MAIL_SUPPRESS_KEY must be set. mailHash returns null without it (membership/mail-suppress.mjs fails
//      closed on purpose), so no identity can be minted at all. This is not a soft degradation: with no key
//      there is nothing to write, and a run that "succeeded" having written zero records would be a lie.
//
//   2. MAIL_ENROLL_UNSUB_PROVEN must name the evidence that a real unsubscribe works end to end.
//      THE REASON IS THE ONLY REASON THAT MATTERS: auto-enrolment was approved with an explicit rider that
//      the opt-out is not deferrable. This write is close to irreversible at full population scale, so if it
//      lands before the opt-out is demonstrated, the entire member base is enrolled with no working way out,
//      which is precisely the state the rider exists to prevent. Enrolment and the unsubscribe path are
//      owned by different sessions, and each could reasonably assume the other held this gate. So it is
//      held here, in the thing that does the writing.
//      Set it to the evidence: a delivered message id, a clicked link, a read-back suppression marker.
//
// The dry run needs neither gate and is the whole point until the owner is back to provision the key.
//
// ONE INVARIANT THIS SCRIPT OWES THE REST OF THE SYSTEM: every `source: 'member'` subscriber record it
// writes carries `githubId`. Erasure cannot resolve a member's address through Stripe once their Customer is
// gone or carries no email, so it finds their records by scanning `mail:subscriber:*` and matching that
// field. A record without it would send mail perfectly well and be invisible to deletion. This is now
// enforced by buildSubscriber itself rather than by this file remembering to do it, but it is stated here
// too because THIS is the code that writes at population scale, and a future edit here is the likeliest
// place for it to be quietly dropped.
