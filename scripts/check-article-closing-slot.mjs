// Build guard (sow-183 QA follow-up): the article "closing" slot (AuthorBox/"Written by" and, until sow-435, CommunityInvite,
// and the Comments section, all composed once in src/pages/articles/[slug].astro and shared across every
// Article*.astro layout) rendered completely EMPTY on every non-Journal article for a while, because Astro
// silently drops every statically-slotted sibling on a page when ANY ONE slotted child uses a non-literal
// slot attribute. That regression shipped, passed the full unit suite, and passed every other check:*
// guard, since none of them render or inspect an article page's body content -- it was caught only by manual
// inspection. This guard closes that gap: it renders no component itself, but scans the BUILT HTML of every
// article page for markers that only appear when ContentFooter's children actually rendered, so a future
// recurrence of the same bug class fails the build instead of shipping silently.
//
// Honest limitation: this only proves what CONTENT actually renders. Today every published post carries
// layout: journal (the sow-183 backfill), so this guard exercises Journal on every real page it checks;
// Editorial's and Card's own slot wiring gets ZERO live coverage until a post actually uses one of them (the
// LAYOUT_SIGNATURES note below reports this plainly rather than implying broader coverage than it has).
