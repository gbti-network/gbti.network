// sow-213 Phase 1: where the PR gate reads bans and grandfather grants from.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. `house/bans.yml` and `house/grandfathered.yml` are person-keyed records of real
// people in a PUBLIC, forkable, CDN-cached repository, so they are on the wrong side of the storage boundary
// (content in git, user data in KV) and no right-to-erasure request can ever be satisfied for them. Moving
// them is the fix. But `scripts/pr-gate.mjs` reads them off the git checkout and has no KV access, so moving
// them naively breaks the gate IN THE FAIL-OPEN DIRECTION: a banned author would pass the ban check.
//
// THE FAIL-OPEN IS NOT CREATED BY THE MIGRATION, IT IS EXPOSED BY IT. `membership/overrides.mjs` readYaml
// returns {} for a missing file, so an absent source yields an EMPTY bans map, and an empty bans map is
// indistinguishable from "nobody is banned". Today the file is always present in a checkout, so the path is
// unreachable. The moment the source becomes a network call, "unavailable" becomes a real runtime state and
// that latent fail-open becomes reachable. Everything below exists to make that state DENY instead.
//
// THE MODE IS DERIVED FROM REALITY, NOT FROM CONFIGURATION. An env flag defaulting to the permissive mode is
// a fail-open waiting for someone to forget to flip it, and the whole point of this SOW is to stop shipping
// those. Instead: if the git files are GONE, KV is mandatory and an unhealthy mirror denies. That flips
// itself at exactly the right instant, because the thing that makes KV mandatory is the same act that removes
// the fallback. There is nothing to remember.

 * above, one level up. With this exported, the test drives mode -> read -> assignment -> evaluatePR and
 * asserts the decision itself.

  // it shipped a repository-wide outage on a daily timer. Both halves are worth stating, because the
  // correction is not "relax the check", it is "the check was measuring the wrong thing".
  //
  // WHY IT WAS AN OUTAGE. `scripts/reconcile.mjs` main() writes the KV mirror (mirrorOverridesToKv) and THEN
  // merges the coupon fold PR into house/grandfathered.yml (syncCouponGrants, further down main()). Its own
  // comment records that the run cannot see its own merge, so the mirror is written from the pre-merge
  // checkout BY DESIGN. The moment that PR lands, git
  // carries a grant KV does not, every gate run throws, and `pr-gate.mjs` publishes `membership-gate` as a
  // FAILING required check for EVERY open PR until the next 6-hourly sync. Measured on 2026-08-18: reconcile
  // ran 07:55Z, the next sync ran 13:10Z. A five-hour blackout, repeating daily, triggered by a coupon
  // redemption. The same shape appears in reverse whenever an unban, an ungrandfather or an erase-member
  // removes an entry from git and the mirror still carries it.
  //
  // WHY THE CHECK WAS MEASURING THE WRONG THING. In this mode `overrides` was loaded from GIT and git is what
  // the gate decides on: the branch below never reassigned the maps. So walk the four divergence cases and
  // ask what denying the whole repository actually bought:
  //   ban in git only          -> already enforced, the git map has it. Denying everyone adds NOTHING.
  //   grandfather in git only  -> already granted from git. Denying everyone adds NOTHING.
  //   grandfather in KV only   -> NOT granted, the gate reads git. Denying everyone adds NOTHING.
  //   ban in KV only           -> NOT enforced. This is the only case with any security content at all.
  // Three of the four were pure self-inflicted downtime. The fourth deserves a better answer than an outage.
  //
  // THE BETTER ANSWER, AND THERE IS NO GUESSWORK IN IT. A ban is RESTRICTIVE, so the union is the fail-closed
  // direction: banned in EITHER source means banned. That answers the original objection rather than dodging
  // it, because we no longer have to decide which source is stale. Both readings ("git has not caught up" and
  // "KV has not caught up") agree that the person is banned, so adopting the KV-only ban is correct under
  // both. It also denies exactly the right person instead of everybody, and it is what makes a Phase 2
  // KV-native ban actually BITE before Phase 3 removes the files, which the throw never did.
  //
  // A GRANDFATHER GRANT IS NOT UNIONED, AND THAT ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE POINT. It is PERMISSIVE: honouring a
  // KV-only grant would hand paid status to anyone able to write that blob, which is fail-OPEN. While git is
  // present it stays the attesting source for permissive records. Restrictive records union, permissive
  // records do not. Phase 3 removes the git files and the 'kv' branch above takes over, at which point the
