// SOW-005 reconcile: PURE planning. No I/O, no clients, no dates from the wall clock except the

// content index into an ordered list of actions. scripts/reconcile.mjs enacts them via the GitHub,
// Discord, and email clients (unless --dry-run).
//
// Fail closed everywhere: a member with an unknown or error status is treated as NOT paid, so their
// published content is flipped to draft. We never default-open.
//
// Idempotency is the core contract: an action is only emitted when the desired state does NOT already
// hold. Running the plan against an already-correct repo + role set yields an empty action list.
//
// Effective-status precedence (from membership/overrides.mjs effectiveStatus): ban > staff >
// grandfather > Stripe. We re-read effective.status here rather than re-deriving, so the two cannot diverge.
