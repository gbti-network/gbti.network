// SOW-166: the PURE planning core for the weekly-digest member backfill. No IO, no crypto, no Date.now()
// inside (callers inject `now`), so the whole decision surface is unit-testable with plain objects. The
// runner (scripts/mail-enroll.mjs) does the Stripe walk, the HMAC and the KV writes around these transforms.
//
// TWO BACKFILLS, ONE POPULATION WALK. Enrolment writes `mail:subscriber:<hash>`; the follow backfill writes
// `follows:<github_id>`. They are planned together because they answer the same question about the same
// people and a second enumeration is how two counts start disagreeing.
//
// POPULATION (owner, 2026-08-21): every Stripe Customer carrying a github_id, MINUS banned. Paid, trial,
// free and lapsed are all IN. Lapsed are deliberately in scope: they are the ones a digest wins back.
//
// AUTO-ENROLMENT IS THE APPROVED DESIGN (sow-166 questions 3 and 4, resolved 2026-08-16), and it is approved
// WITH A RIDER: the opt-out is not deferrable. That rider is enforced here rather than trusted, in the one
// way a planner can enforce it: a suppressed address is NEVER re-enrolled, so somebody who has already
// unsubscribed cannot be swept back in by a later run of this backfill. The marker outlives the record
// precisely so this check has something to read (membership/mail-suppress.mjs).
//
// WHY UNREACHABLE IS A FIRST-CLASS RESULT AND NOT A SKIP. Override-only members (grandfathered, no Stripe
// Customer) carry `email: null` from gatherOverrideOnlyMembers (scripts/lib/reconcile-members.mjs). There is
// no address for them ANYWHERE in the system, so they cannot be enrolled by any means, and no amount of
// retrying changes that. A silent skip would be indistinguishable from success in every count the owner
// reads. They are returned BY NAME so the owner can decide per person.
