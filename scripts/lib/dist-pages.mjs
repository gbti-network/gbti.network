// Shared enumeration of BUILT detail pages, for the dist guards.
//
// WHY THIS IS SHARED RATHER THAN PRIVATE TO ONE GUARD. Two guards need the same question answered: which
// content-type detail pages did this build actually emit. check-article-closing-slot needs it to know
// whether it has any subjects (a run with none proves nothing), and sow-242's per-content-type coverage
// floor needs it to require that each BUILT section yields at least one checked item. Two implementations
// of "walk dist and find the detail pages" would drift, and the drift would be silent in both directions:
// a guard that enumerates slightly differently from its sibling reports slightly different coverage and
// nobody can tell which is right.
//
// It answers ONLY what was built. It deliberately does not read the content collections, because a guard
// that compares dist against its own reimplementation of the publish rules is asserting that two copies of
// a rule agree, not that the build is correct. The build is the authority for what exists; these guards
// check what is IN what was built.
