//   - the per-member KV deletes: activity:<id> (favorites+collections), follows:<id> (the follow graph),
//     gh:<id> (the Stripe-customer lookup cache);
//   - Discord: removes the member's managed roles (Member/Trial/Locked);

//     entry (reversible; git history persists, disclosed in the TOS);
//   - Stripe customer delete ONLY when --delete-stripe is explicitly passed (irreversible; tax-retention).
// Crypto-shred (the global SOW-016 key rotation) and de-index stay manual. Every step is identity-minimally

 *     GitHub client needed, so a member with no folder still gets their grant stripped.

 *     members-index entry. Reversible (a re-subscribe / un-erase can re-publish); git history persists, disclosed
 *     in the TOS. Reported no-op without a GitHub client or any net git change. `files` is the member's content
 *     descriptors ([{ path, status }]) from buildRepoIndex; reading happens in the caller so this is testable
 *     with a fake github client.
 *
 * The GRANDFATHERED removal was added 2026-08-11 (SecurityMaster's adjudication). Until Step 3 it lived in a
 * PUBLIC git file carrying the github_id, login, a `reason` describing the commercial relationship, and an
 * `until`; the storage-boundary ruling moved that person-keyed record off the public chain into KV, and this
 * erasure follows it there. Fail LOUD on a KV write error: a GDPR erasure that could not remove a grant is
 * exactly the silent gap this must never have.
