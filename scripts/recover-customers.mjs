// sow-166 / sow-157: create the Stripe Customers that make the recovered legacy members REACHABLE by email.
//
//   node scripts/recover-customers.mjs                 # dry run (the default), writes NOTHING
//   node scripts/recover-customers.mjs --apply         # create the Customers + their gh: index entries
//
//   MAIL_LEGACY_DUMP=/abs/path/to/dump.sql             # required from a detached worktree (.data/ is gitignored)
//   MAIL_ENROLL_EXTRA='login=address,login=address'    # owner-supplied addresses, same contract as the enrolment
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND THE FAILURE IT IS THE FIX FOR. `scripts/lib/stripe-backfill.mjs` was written with the
// planner and the executor complete and NO CALLER, and its own header predicted exactly what would happen
// without one: a `source: 'member'` subscriber record stores no address, the drain resolves it from the
// member's Stripe Customer at send time, and a member with no Customer resolves to null and never sends.
//
// On 2026-08-25 that is precisely what happened. The first digest went out at 07:00 Central to 18 enrolled
// members and 12 of them failed inside 300ms each, terminally, because they have no Customer. The library
// said so in a comment weeks earlier. This file is the missing half.
//
// TERMINAL MEANS TERMINAL, so read this before assuming a re-run resends. The drain marks "resolved but no
// address" as failed and does NOT retry (mail-drain.mjs:312), so creating the Customers does not by itself
// deliver anything. What it does is make the NEXT welcome sweep able to reach them: their subscriber records
// still carry `welcomedAt: null`, so the next daily welcome issue re-enqueues them. Sending sooner than that
// is a separate, deliberate act.
//
// IT NEVER PRINTS, LOGS, RETURNS OR STORES AN ADDRESS. The planner is told only WHETHER one exists; the
// address is read from the dump and handed to Stripe at the moment of the POST and nowhere else. That is
// stripe-backfill's design and this file must not be the place that breaks it, so every report line here is
// keyed by github_id and login only. If you are adding a debug line, this is the paragraph you are about to
// contradict.
//
// SCOPE IS THE ALLOW-SET, ENFORCED IN CODE. The dump holds ~68 accounts, roughly 50 of whom registered on the
// old site and were never comped; reaching them was explicitly NOT approved. The allow-set is read from the KV
// overrides mirror (sow-213 Step 2), exactly as the enrolment script reads it, and nothing outside it can be
// resolved. The read fails closed: an unavailable, stale or malformed mirror aborts rather than widening scope.

// sow-213 Step 2 (R5): the grandfathered allow-set reads the KV overrides mirror, and this IMPORTS that reader
// from mail-enroll-legacy.mjs rather than re-declaring it. Before R6 guarded that module's top-level main(),
// importing it RAN the enrolment and exited the process, which is why this file kept its own copy of the
// helper. R6 made the module importable, so the two copies collapse into ONE reader with one fail-closed
// contract and one set of tests (mail-enroll-legacy.test.mjs).
