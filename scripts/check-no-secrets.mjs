// Defense-in-depth secret guard. Scans the files that WOULD be committed (it mirrors .gitignore by
// skipping the same paths) for credential patterns, so a real key can never reach git even if a key is
// pasted into a tracked file or .gitignore is weakened. The real secret files (.env, **/.dev.vars) are
// gitignored and skipped here, as are *.example placeholders. Node builtins only (no deps), so it runs
// anywhere: `npm run check:secrets`, the .githooks/pre-commit hook, and .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml.
//
// IMAGES ARE SCANNED TOO (2026-08-18). They were skipped entirely, because the walk only read a fixed list
// of text extensions. That was a real blind spot rather than a theoretical one: `.product/` exists to hold
// images, it is tracked, and its Chrome Web Store assets are UI SCREENSHOTS that ship to a global listing.
// A credential in an image reached git completely unexamined.
//
// HOW, AND WHY IT IS NOT PER-FORMAT PARSING. Every container has somewhere to put text (PNG tEXt/iTXt/zTXt,
// JPEG EXIF and COM, WebP and GIF comments) and anything appended after the terminating chunk is in the file
// too. Rather than parse five formats, extract printable ASCII runs from the bytes and apply the SAME
// patterns. Format-agnostic, no new dependency, and it covers containers nobody thought about.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, STATED PLAINLY SO NOBODY OVER-TRUSTS IT: it does not read PIXELS. A token VISIBLE in
// a screenshot passes this guard silently. There is no cheap fix for that (OCR is a dependency and a
// different order of cost), so the control for it remains a human looking at any screenshot before it ships.
// A guard that covers metadata is not a guard that covers screenshots, and the difference is the whole risk.
