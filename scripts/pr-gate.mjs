// SOW-005 PR-gate: the merge gate that decides whether a content PR may merge.
//
// Runs from a `pull_request_target` workflow on the BASE branch (see
// .github/workflows/pr-membership-gate.yml). It reads ONLY PR metadata (author github_id,
// changed file paths via the GitHub API) and NEVER checks out or executes the PR's code. That
// one rule is the whole security model: violating it would leak the Stripe and GitHub secrets
// this script holds. See .data/specs/roles-and-capabilities.md "The one rule that must never
// be broken".
//
// Flow per PR:
//   1. Resolve the author github_id -> effective membership status (Stripe + git-native
//      overrides: ban > grandfather > stripe; the staff tier of the full ban > staff >
//      grandfather > stripe precedence is applied in step 2 by role, not here). Fail closed:
//      any lookup error is NOT paid.
//   2. Classify the changed paths against the author's role and owned folder, then apply the
//      shared decide() merge rules (the SAME module the SOW-003 scoping CI imports, so the two
//      can never diverge).
//   3. Publish the verdict as the required status check `membership-gate` (success | failure)
//      plus a single label.
// Any thrown error sets a FAILING status (fail closed), so an outage can never default-open a
// content PR.
