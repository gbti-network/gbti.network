// sow-185: the deploy.yml CLI wrapper for the "still deploying" public-page notice. Two subcommands, run as
// two separate steps in the SAME job (so the same runner filesystem carries state between them):
//
//   node scripts/deploy-status.mjs mark    # BEFORE the build: mark changed content items pending in KV
//   node scripts/deploy-status.mjs clear   # AFTER a successful deploy: clear those same markers
//
// `mark` diffs from a durable watermark (deploy:last-marked-sha in SIGNUP_KV), not just this push's own
// `before`, so a run skipped by deploy.yml's own concurrency group during a burst never loses its slice of
// the diff (see scripts/lib/deploy-status-kv.mjs's header comment for the full reasoning). The marked item
// list is handed to `clear` via a small JSON file in the OS temp dir, so `clear` acts on exactly what `mark`
// marked rather than re-deriving it.
//
// This is an informational nicety, never a gate: unlike scripts/lib/kv-mirror.mjs's writes (which THROW on a
// real API error, deliberately failing the reconcile run loudly), every failure here is caught and logged,
// and the process always exits 0. A KV hiccup must never be capable of failing a site deploy.
//
// `mark`/`clear` take injectable deps (env, fetchImpl, gitDiff, readState/writeState) so the orchestration
// itself -- not just the pure lib functions it calls -- is directly unit-tested (test/deploy-status.test.mjs),
// including the watermark-only-advances-on-confirmed-success sequencing this file exists to get right.
