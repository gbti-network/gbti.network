// SOW-186 phase 4 (DELIVERY): the follow-the-author EMAIL fan-out runner, a step in the publish Action
// (.github/workflows/syndicate-content.yml). Given the content files that TRANSITIONED to published in a push, it
// resolves, per published post/product/prompt, the followers who have turned the EMAIL channel on and are
// mailable, and ENQUEUES one eager notification mail issue per item (workers/signup/mail-store.mjs enqueueIssue).
// It SENDS NOTHING: the notification issue is a normal eager issue that the existing */5 Worker drain drains
// behind the same fail-closed send gate, rate budget, suppression re-check and one-click unsubscribe as the
// weekly digest (the drain reads only issueId from an issue and is never touched here).
//
//   node scripts/enqueue-notifications.mjs --added members/alice/posts/x/index.md      # dry-run (no KV write)
//   node scripts/enqueue-notifications.mjs --apply --added <path> [<path> ...]         # resolve + enqueue to KV
//   node scripts/enqueue-notifications.mjs --apply                                     # push mode: diff BEFORE..AFTER
// Requires (for --apply): CF_ACCOUNT_ID / CF_KV_NAMESPACE_ID / CF_API_TOKEN (the same SIGNUP_KV the Worker drains).
// Needs NO Stripe and NO MAIL_SUPPRESS_KEY: a recipient's mail hash comes from their own member subscriber record
// (mail-subscriber.mjs requires githubId), never recomputed from an address.
//
// WHY THE PUBLISH ACTION (not the drain). Fan-out at publish keeps the drain byte-for-byte unchanged, so the
// notification path cannot weaken a guard the digest path shares (SowMaster's binding condition, 2026-08-22); and
// REST from the Action has no 50-subrequest Worker ceiling. See membership/mail-notify.mjs for the full rationale.
//
// LEAK GUARD: an item is a candidate ONLY when publicUrlFor returns a non-null url (scripts/lib/content-
// syndication.mjs: null for a members-only / Mode A body and for every share). A gated item is never enqueued;
// the issue carries only public metadata (author, name, type, title, url); the renderer reads a fixed allow-list.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED + DORMANT: resolveNotify (membership/notify-resolve.mjs) defaults the email channel OFF, so until a
// member opts in via the settings surface AND has a mailable subscriber record AND the owner opens the send gate
// AND the MAIL_* secrets are provisioned, this resolves to zero recipients. The scale confirms it is safe now:
// OnboardingMaster measured 22 members, 2 mailable, and no email-on preferences exist yet, so a live run today
// enqueues nothing.
