// sow-166 follow-up: enrol the GRANDFATHERED co-op members into the digest using their LEGACY WordPress
// address, because they predate Stripe and have no address anywhere in the running system.
//
//   node scripts/mail-enroll-legacy.mjs              # dry run (the default), writes NOTHING
//   node scripts/mail-enroll-legacy.mjs --apply      # enact, behind the same two gates as mail-enroll.mjs
//
//   MAIL_ENROLL_EXTRA='login=address,login=address'  # owner-supplied addresses for members the dump cannot
//                                                    # reach. Allow-set still binds; see applySuppliedAddresses.
//
// SCOPE IS THE OWNER DECISION OF 2026-08-24 AND IT IS ENFORCED IN CODE, NOT BY INVOCATION. The dump holds 68
// accounts. Roughly 50 of them are people who registered on the old site and were never comped, and reaching
// them was explicitly NOT approved. The allow-set is therefore built from house/grandfathered.yml and passed
// into matchLegacyAddresses, which cannot resolve an address outside it. Widening the scope means editing
// the allow-set in code and is not something a flag can do.
//
// THE SAME TWO GATES AS THE MAIN BACKFILL, for the same reasons:
//   1. MAIL_SUPPRESS_KEY, without which mailHash returns null and no identity can be minted at all.
//   2. MAIL_ENROLL_UNSUB_PROVEN, naming the evidence that a real unsubscribe works end to end. Auto-enrolment
//      was approved with an explicit rider that the opt-out is not deferrable.
//
// AND ONE GATE THE MAIN BACKFILL DOES NOT NEED: the SEND allowlist. These 15 hashes are not on
// MAIL_SEND_ALLOWLIST, so enrolling them writes a subscriber record that the drain will refuse until the
// owner adds the hashes. That ordering is deliberate. Enrolment is reversible, sending is not, so the
// reversible half happens first and the irreversible half needs a human. This script PRINTS the hashes for
// that purpose and NEVER prints an address.
//
// WHAT THEY RECEIVE. A newly enrolled subscriber has welcomedAt null, so the welcome sweep sends them the
// 90-day welcome issue rather than a thin weekly. That is the intended introduction for somebody who has
// not heard from the network since the WordPress site.
