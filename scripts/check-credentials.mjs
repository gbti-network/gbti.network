// Credential health check (SOW secrets-ops): probe each live credential and EMAIL the owner via Resend when one
// is failing or near expiry, so a lapsed token never breaks the system silently. Runs weekly + on demand
// (.github/workflows/credential-health.yml). Also exits non-zero on any problem, so the Action goes red as a
// backup signal even if email is unconfigured.
//
// What it checks (only credentials available as Actions secrets can be live-probed):
//   - GitHub PAT (GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN): a cheap repo read. The response header
//     `github-authentication-token-expiration` reports the token's real expiry, so the date AUTO-TRACKS rotation.
//   - Stripe read key (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY): list one customer (no expiry; liveness only).
//   - Discord bot token (DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN): GET /users/@me (no expiry; liveness only).
//   - Cloudflare token (CF_API_TOKEN): /user/tokens/verify, must be active, must carry an EXPIRY (mustExpire,
//     since account-level KV write cannot be confined by scope), and must not carry a `not_before` in the
//     future, which reads as active while rejecting every call.
// REGATE_DISPATCH_TOKEN is Worker-only (not an Actions secret), so it is NOT probed here; its expiry is tracked
// in .data/ops/secrets-ops/README.md (it expires ~the same time as GH_BOT_TOKEN, so this alert is the reminder).
//
// Run: node scripts/check-credentials.mjs   (with the secrets in env). Pure helpers are exported for tests.
