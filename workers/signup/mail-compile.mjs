// SOW-166: the weekly compile orchestrator (Worker IO). Once a week it gathers the public content + the news,
// calls composeIssue ONCE to freeze a single issue (mail:issue:<issueId>), and enqueues one pending send record
// per subscriber. It sends NOTHING: the drain (on the shared */5 tick, behind the fail-closed send gate) is what
// releases sends. Compile once, drain smoothly (Q12).
//
// PURE CORE, INJECTED IO. The mapping + the issue id live in membership/mail-compile-core.mjs (unit-tested with
// no IO). This module supplies the three gathers (content artifacts over HTTP, news from NEWS_KV + the SOW-111
// open counts, the subscriber base) and orchestrates. Every dep is injectable so the whole orchestrator is
// tested with fakes.
//
// ALWAYS-SEND (owner ruling, 2026-08-21): the compile always composes + enqueues, even a fully-empty week (a
// non-state anyway, since news ingests daily). The gate is shouldSend(issue) from the composer, which returns
// true unconditionally and carries the ruling; keeping it as the gate (rather than deleting it) means the day
// the owner ever wants a skip, it is one honest predicate to change.
//
// FROZEN + IDEMPOTENT. The issue id is the stable weekly-YYYY-MM-DD, so a re-run of the same day's compile finds
// the frozen issue and does not recompose; enqueueIssue is idempotent (it never duplicates or resurrects a
// terminal record), so re-enqueuing only picks up subscribers added since. Content leak safety is composeIssue's
// (visibility === 'public', fail closed); this module only moves already-public metadata.

/**
 * Resolve the composeIssue window for a NEW issue. `since` and `exclude` are a FILTER and a FLOOR applied
 * TOGETHER, not alternatives (SowMaster ruling + PublicationMaster correction, 2026-08-21; composeIssue chains
 * both filters):
 *   - FIRST issue (no prior frozen issue): { firstIssue: true, since: nowMs - bootstrapMs, exclude: null }.
 *     A bounded, launch-worded issue rather than the newest-N-ever back catalogue. bootstrapMs defaults to
 *     BOOTSTRAP_MS (90 days, owner ruling 2026-08-22) so the inaugural issue is not empty; see the constant.
 *   - THEREAFTER (a prior exists): { firstIssue: false, since: the COUPLED floor, exclude: <mailed urls> }.
 *     The floor drops everything published too long ago to still be excludable; exclude drops what has already
 *     been mailed. Together: mail everything published since the newsletter began that has not been mailed yet,
 *     exactly once however late it arrives. This CLOSES Trap Two (a held or backdated item published DURING the
 *     newsletter's life stays eligible until mailed) WITHOUT re-opening the back-catalogue drain: `since = null`
 *     would make the pool the whole 40-per-type artifact, so issue two would mail the pre-newsletter archive and
 *     walk backwards in time, and the empty-section notes would be unreachable until it drained. A floor cannot
 *     cut off a contribution held for days; only a tight per-issue window could, and this is not one.
 *
 * sow-297, 2026-08-31 (owner ruling): A WEEKLY ISSUE IS ONE WEEK. Everything above still runs and still
 * matters, but it is no longer the thing that decides what a weekly carries. The owner ruled the weekly covers
 * the last week only, so a reader is not handed a draining archive under a "since the last issue" heading; the
 * full back catalogue is the WELCOME issue's job, and every new subscriber gets 90 days of it as their first
 * email, so widening this one would only duplicate that.
 *
 * The week is measured on VISIBILITY. `seen` is the previous issue's recorded `pool`, the urls of every public
 * due item the artifact carried at THAT compile, so an item is new to this issue exactly when it is not in it.
 * Cutting `since` to seven days instead would have reintroduced Trap Two whole: publishedAt is stamped when the
 * PR is opened, so a contribution held for review for eight days sits below a seven-day floor on the very day it
 * first becomes visible, and would never be mailed at all. A pool diff cannot lose it, because it was not in
 * last week's pool.
 *
 * BOOTSTRAP, and it fires exactly once. Issues frozen before this change carry no `pool`, so the first compile
 * after it has nothing to diff against. It then falls back to `since = the previous issue's compile time`, which
 * is the same question answered with the weaker publishedAt proxy: published after the last compile. That is
 * only wrong for an item published before the last compile and merged after it, it is wrong for one week, and
 * it is wrong in the direction the owner chose anyway (the standing backlog does not re-enter the weekly; a new
 * subscriber still meets it in the welcome). From the following week the pool exists and the proxy is never
 * consulted again.
 *
 * The floor MUST be coupled to the exclude window or a third trap opens: the floor is time-based and exclude is
 * issue-count-based, so an item can sit ABOVE a fixed epoch floor and OUTSIDE the rolling exclude window at once,
 * and then re-mails on a historyDepth cycle (the product/prompt/share artifacts never turn over, so exclude is the
 * only thing stopping a re-mail, and it expires at historyDepth). So while nothing has aged out of the window the
 * floor is the FIRST issue's launch floor (its recorded `window.since`, the epoch), and the moment an issue ages
 * OUT the floor advances to the COMPILE TIME of the oldest issue still IN the window: anything an aged-out issue
 * mailed was published no later than its compile, hence below this floor. historyDepth stays the single tunable,
 * and there is no separate accumulator to drift: both the mailed set and the floor are read from the frozen
 * issues themselves.

/**
 * sow-166: compile (or reuse) the standing WELCOME issue and enqueue every subscriber who has never had one.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SWEEP OVER STATE RATHER THAN A HOOK ON SIGNUP. The welcome has to fire whenever a subscriber
 * becomes ACTIVE, and that happens on three different paths today and tomorrow: at confirmation under double
 * opt-in, at submission if double opt-in is ever switched off (owner, 2026-08-23), and in bulk when the member
 * backfill runs. A hook would have to be remembered at each one, and the failure mode of forgetting is silent:
 * the subscriber simply never gets the only 90-day view they will be offered. Sweeping for `welcomedAt == null`
 * cannot be forgotten by a new creation path, because every path ends at putSubscriber.
 *
 * Runs on the same five-minute cron tick as the drain, so a new subscriber waits at most five minutes.
 *
 * The issue id is `welcome-YYYY-MM-DD`, which listPriorIssueIds cannot count, so this NEVER advances the
 * weekly epoch floor and NEVER contributes its 90 days of urls to the weekly exclude set.
