// Signup orchestration (membership-and-access.md section 3). Given the identity already resolved by
// the two OAuth callbacks (github_id + login, discord_user_id + email + access_token), this:
//   1. creates OR reuses the Stripe Customer keyed by the immutable github_id (idempotent),
//   2. NEVER resets trial_started_at on an existing Customer (the trial clock is set once, at first
//      creation, and is sacred),
//   3. writes the github_id -> customer_id KV index entry for instant, consistent gate lookups,
//   4. adds the user to the Discord guild with the Trial role (guilds.join via the user's token),
//   5. returns the customer id + a flag for the caller to mint a signed session cookie.
//
// Pure-ish: all side-effecting collaborators (stripe, discord, kv) are injected, so the whole chain
// is fixture-testable with no network. Fail closed only applies to membership STATUS decisions.
//
// WHICH ERRORS ESCAPE, because the two halves of this function differ and used not to. The Stripe and KV
// steps still throw to the caller: they are the durable record, they are idempotent, and a retry is the
// right answer. The Discord guild calls at the end do NOT, because by the time they run the durable work is
// already committed, so throwing discarded a finished signup to report its least important step. They record
// their outcome in `discordOutcome` and log which call failed instead.
//
// This module imports the frozen Stripe + Discord client contracts via the orchestrator's injected
// instances; it does not construct them itself (the Worker entrypoint wires them with real secrets).

 * sow-218: WHICH managed Discord role this member should hold, resolved from what they actually are.
 *
 * Signup used to hand every linking member ONE hardcoded role. That is wrong for everyone it does not describe,
 * and the correction only arrived on the next daily reconcile: a paying subscriber, a grandfathered member, a
 * superadmin and a Codeable invitee all got Locked, and because a coupon grant folds into grandfathered.yml
 * AFTER roles are computed in the same run, an invitee waited up to TWO daily cycles.
 *
 * Costs one KV read. The Stripe derivation is free: runSignup already fetched the customer with its
 * subscriptions expanded (clients/stripe.mjs expands them on searchCustomerByGithubId), and
 * deriveMembershipFromCustomer is pure over that object.
 *
 * The mirror read is REQUIRED, not a nicety. Without folding ban > staff > grandfather, a banned member whose
 * Stripe still says paid would be handed the member role, which is a worse fail-open than the bug being fixed.
 * A stale, absent or unreadable mirror therefore resolves to `locked`, which is exactly the previous behaviour,
 * so every failure path degrades into the status quo rather than into something new.
 *
 * A live coupon grant counts as paid here. It is the whole point of the invite, and it is authoritative before
 * the fold lands: the same fast path membership-status.mjs uses to report a fresh redeemer as paid.
