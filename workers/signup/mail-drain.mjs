// a per-recipient sent marker, and an attempts cap, all over the pure core membership/mail-queue.mjs. What the
// mail drain adds over syndication:
//   - a HARD, FAIL-CLOSED rate budget (sends-today + sends-this-month), so a lost counter read sends NOTHING
//     this tick rather than freely (the free-tier caps are the whole reason the send is smoothed);
//   - a SEND-TIME suppression gate: an unsubscribe that lands mid-window (between the weekly compile and this
//     recipient's tick) is honored before the email goes out, because the marker is checked on every record;
//   - address resolution deferred to send time (a member from Stripe, an anon by decrypting emailEnc), so the
//     queue never stores a raw address (data-protection.md:49).
//
// PURE over injected kv/now/resolveAddress/renderIssue/sendEmail, so the whole engine is unit-tested with fakes
// (no network, no Resend, no Stripe). The Worker wiring supplies the real resolver, renderer and Resend send.
