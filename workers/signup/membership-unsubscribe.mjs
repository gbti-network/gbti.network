// SOW-166: the one-click unsubscribe route for the weekly digest. Auto-enrolment of members was granted on the
// explicit rider that a WORKING, non-deferrable one-click opt-out ships with it, so this is not a later phase:
// it is the control that makes forced enrolment lawful and protects the sending domain's reputation.
//
// RFC 8058 (List-Unsubscribe / List-Unsubscribe-Post), and WHY the split matters:
//   - A mail client that supports one-click sends a POST to the List-Unsubscribe URL with the body
//     `List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`. POST is what PERFORMS the unsubscribe here.
//   - Mail clients and security scanners routinely PREFETCH links with GET. If GET performed the unsubscribe,
//     a prefetch would silently opt people out. So GET NEVER mutates: it renders a confirmation page whose
//     button POSTs back to the same URL. Both paths converge on POST.
//
// THE TOKEN IS THE AUTHORIZATION (membership/mail-unsub-token.mjs). The clicker may have no account, so the
// route authenticates nobody: a valid capability token bound to the subscriber hash is the whole proof. The
// URL carries `?h=<mailHash>&t=<token>`; the hash is the pseudonymous mailHash, never the address, so the URL
// space is not enumerable and no address is exposed to a referrer or a proxy log. Verification is fail-closed:
// no secret configured, a malformed hash, or a bad token => NOTHING is suppressed.
//
// ORDER OF WRITES: suppress FIRST, then erase. The suppression marker must exist before the subscriber record
// is torn down, so there is never a window where the record is gone but the opt-out is not recorded (which
// would let a re-subscribe silently un-suppress). eraseSubscriberMail never touches the marker, so the two are
// independent and both idempotent; a retried POST is safe.
//
// INJECTABLE for unit testing (no network, no crypto stubs needed beyond crypto.subtle, which is global): kv,
// the verifier, the erase, and the suppress-write are all overridable, defaulting to the real implementations.
