// SOW-150 / SOW-186: the member NOTIFICATION endpoint over the deletable edge store (KV).
//   GET  /membership/notifications        -> { ok, notifications, unseen }   (the caller's OWN list)
//   POST /membership/notifications/seen   -> { ok, notifications, unseen }   (mark the caller's own seen)
//     body { ids?: [id] }  -- an absent/empty ids list marks ALL of the caller's notifications seen
//     body { bellSeen }    -- owner, 2026-09-29: merge what the member has read in the two bells (membership/bell-seen.mjs)
//                             and touch nothing else; answers { ok, bellSeen }. GET returns bellSeen too.
//
// SOW-060: reading your own notifications is a FREE-tier perk. Auth = SIGNED-IN, non-banned (authorizeMember:
// ban > staff > grandfather > Stripe, fail-closed from the KV overrides mirror), NOT effective-paid. Data is
// keyed notifications:<github_id> in SIGNUP_KV, so it is per-member, private, and ERASABLE
// (eraseMemberNotifications = a hard KV delete; SOW-024 right-to-erasure runbook). The caller only ever
// reads/mutates THEIR OWN key (the authorized github_id), so there is no cross-member read or write here.
//
// The WRITE (append) path is deliverNotification below, called SERVER-SIDE by a trusted trigger (the SOW-150
// mention endpoint; the SOW-186 follow-publish delivery), NEVER by the recipient over HTTP. It is deliberately
// not an HTTP endpoint: a member cannot post arbitrary rows into their own bell or anyone else's.
//
// The transforms are the pure membership/member-notifications.mjs core; this handler only does auth + the KV
// read-modify-write, so it is unit-tested with a fake KV + a stubbed authorizer (no network, no secrets).
