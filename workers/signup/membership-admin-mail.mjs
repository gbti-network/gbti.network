// sow-166 follow-up (2026-08-23): ADMIN-GATED MANUAL MAIL TRIGGERS.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. compileWeeklyIssue and drainMail were reachable ONLY from the cron map in index.mjs
// (`0 12 * * 2` / `0 13 * * 2` and `*/5 * * * *`). A deployed Worker offers no way to fire a scheduled handler by hand, so
// the first end-to-end proof of the mail chain (compile -> enqueue -> drain -> a real message at a real
// address) could not happen before the next weekly cron, and every subsequent re-proof, post-rotation
// check or re-send carried the same week-long turnaround. That is a long feedback loop on the ONE path that
// touches other people's inboxes, which is the path that most deserves a short one.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED, AND THIS ROUTE ADDS NO NEW SEND AUTHORITY. It reuses the exact production functions the cron
// calls, so everything downstream is unchanged: the drain still refuses every recipient outside
// MAIL_SEND_ALLOWLIST (resolveSendGate defaults to `closed`), still honours the daily/monthly/per-tick
// budgets, still re-checks suppression, and still attaches the one-click unsubscribe. An admin firing this
// with the gate closed sends to nobody, by construction. The gate remains the owner's to open.
//
// THE TRAP THIS ROUTE HAD TO DESIGN AROUND, and the reason `test-compile` exists. The issue id is the compile
// DATE (`weekly-YYYY-MM-DD`, mail-compile-core.mjs), and the section window excludes every url carried by a
// PRIOR issue. So a real `compile` fired on a Saturday to rehearse the send does not merely create a spare
// issue: it becomes Tuesday's prior, consumes the 90-day inaugural back catalogue and the launch note, and
// leaves the genuine first issue nearly empty. The rehearsal would quietly spend the thing it was rehearsing
// for. `test-compile` therefore mints a `test-YYYY-MM-DD` id, which listPriorIssueIds cannot count (it filters
// to the canonical `weekly-` shape precisely so a hand-seeded issue is never mistaken for a mailed one), so a
// rehearsal composes exactly what the real inaugural issue will compose and leaves the weekly cadence
// untouched. `discard` then removes the rehearsal so it stops appearing in activeIssueIds forever.

/**
 * POST /membership/admin/mail { action, issueId? }
 *
 *   compile       run the weekly compile exactly as the Tuesday cron does (idempotent by date).
 *   test-compile  the same compile under a `test-YYYY-MM-DD` id that the weekly exclude window ignores.
 *   drain         run the mail drain now instead of waiting for the next 5-minute tick. `issueId` narrows it.
 *   discard       delete a rehearsal issue (test- ids only).
 *
 * `drain` has NO in-module default: the drain's IO (Stripe address lookup, Resend, the renderer dispatch) is
 * composed in index.mjs, and duplicating that wiring here would create a second composition root that can
 * drift from the one the cron actually uses. An uninjected drain is reported as misconfigured, not improvised.
