// sow-214: the article SHELL, owned in one place so the published page and the WorkBench preview cannot
// drift into different layouts again.
//
// They had. preview.astro rendered every content type through the project Doc Shell (.pd-*), never read
// `layout`, and imported one component from the article side, so an article preview was a different page
// from the article. The editor's layout picker changed nothing on screen.
//
// WHAT IS SHARED AND WHAT IS NOT, because the split is not obvious and the next person deserves it stated:
//   - The CSS is already shared. `.art-*` lives in gbti-v3.css, which global.css imports and BaseLayout
//     loads, so the preview page already ships these styles. Adopting the class names costs nothing.
//   - The STRUCTURE is shared here: the class names, the element order, the ids.
//   - The COVER MARKUP is injected, because the two hosts cannot produce the same element. The published
//     page uses Astro's <Image>, which resolves assets at build time; the preview renders on the client
//     from fetched JSON and must emit a plain <img> pointing at the CDN.
//   - The live-data components (byline, actions, favorite counts, discussion) are NOT in the shell. They
//     are Astro components on the published side and deliberately omitted from a draft preview.
//
// The Astro component keeps its own markup, because it composes real components into this structure and
// cannot be rendered on the client. That duplication is made safe by the drift test in
// test/article-page.test.mjs, which compares the two skeletons and fails when one side moves alone.

/**
 * The class + id contract for each article layout, read by both hosts rather than typed as strings twice.
 *
 * sow-214 stage two: Editorial and Card joined Journal here, each read off its own component rather than
 * written from memory. Stage one deliberately shipped Journal alone after a first draft of all three turned
 * out to be invented, so the shape below is deliberately NOT a single template with three prefixes. The three
 * layouts differ structurally, and the fields say how:
 *
 *   - `leadIn` is where the title/cover block belongs. Journal and Card put it inside the reading column;
 *     Editorial hoists it above the grid as a full-bleed hero with the title overlaid on the image.
 *   - `rail` is null for Card, which has no contents rail at all on the published page.
 *   - `spacer` names the grid child Editorial needs but the preview cannot fill. `art-e-grid` is a THREE
 *     column grid (actions strip, column, aside) and grid children take columns in source order, so a host
 *     rendering only two of them would slot the aside into the 60px actions strip. The preview emits an empty
 *     one rather than pretending the grid is two columns.
 *   - `railLast` records that Editorial's aside is the LAST grid child while Journal's rail is the first.
 *   - `overviewId` is false for Card, whose body wrapper carries no id because it has no rail to anchor.
