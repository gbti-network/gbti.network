/**
 * Reshape the workbench preview's project Doc Shell into the page a given content type actually publishes as.
 *
 * The preview page (src/pages/workbench/preview.astro) ships ONE document, the project detail shell, and
 * injects a staged draft into it. That was fine while projects were the only authorable type. It stopped
 * being fine the moment articles and prompts existed: a post preview showed a project hero, and a prompt
 * preview showed a Contents rail, a sticky spec bar and a pricing badge, none of which those pages have.
 *
 * Every branch here RESHAPES rather than re-emits. The preview's rail wiring, body injection, contents
 * scroll-spy, as-a-member toggle and the sow-235 edit path are bound to the elements already in that
 * document, so replacing it would break working behaviour in order to share markup that is not where the
 * drift hurt. What made the previews look like different pages is the geometry and the lead, and those come
 * from the per-type contracts in article-page.mjs and prompt-page.mjs, each held to its published page by a
 * drift test.
 *
 * Lifted out of preview.astro so that file stays inside the 900-line cap with room to work in; it was at 896
 * with both branches inline. This module is where the NEXT type's reshape goes.
 *
 * DOM-dependent by nature, so it is exercised through the preview rather than in the node suite; what IS
 * unit-tested is the contract each branch reads.

 * `nav.hidden = toc.length === 0`, which un-hid it again the moment a body carried two h2s. That is
 * exactly what shipped, and the drift test missed it because it asserts class names, not visibility.
