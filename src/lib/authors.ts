/**
 * The network's own content identity (sow-195). `gbtilabs` is a REAL member folder holding what used to
 * live in `house/`; `gbti` is the retired pseudo-author, kept here so anything written before the move
 * still renders identically. Both display as "GBTI Network", because the folder move is deliberately
 * invisible to readers: the byline, the avatar and the card all read exactly as they did before.
 *
 * This is the ONE place that knows it. Callers that have a profile prefer its displayName
 * (ContentMeta, AuthorBox), and callers that do not (ArticleTeaser) fall through to here, so the two
 * cannot disagree the way they would if only the profile carried the name.
 *
 * A few places treat the house VOICE differently: a share's note is not wrapped in quotation marks when the
 * network wrote it, because it is editorial rather than somebody being quoted (owner, 2026-09-22).
