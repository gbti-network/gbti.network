Getting the Telegram channel ID can be a little tricky, as it’s not directly provided in the Telegram user interface. However, there are several ways you can obtain it:

### Method 1: Via Bot

1.  Add the bot you created to the channel you want to get the ID of.
2.  Make the bot an admin of the channel.
3.  Send any message in the channel.
4.  Use the bot to query updates from the Telegram server. This can be done by running an HTTP request to `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates` in a browser or Postman.
5.  Look for the `"chat"` object in the JSON response. The `id` field inside that object will contain the channel ID.

`{   "update_id": xxxxx,   "channel_post": {     "message_id": xx,     "chat": {       "id": -1001xxxxxxx,  // This is the channel ID       "title": "ChannelTitle",       "type": "channel"     },     // ...   } }`
### Method 2: Via a Forwarded Message

1.  Forward a message from the desired channel to another chat that your bot is part of.
2.  Use the bot to query updates from the Telegram server, as described in Method 1.
3.  The `id` field inside the `chat` object will contain the channel ID.

### Method 3: Bot Code

If you have a bot that’s already part of the channel and you can code, you can use Telegram’s API methods to list all updates or messages in a channel, which will include the channel ID.

Here is a quick example using Python’s `requests` library:

`import requests  token = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" url = f"https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/getUpdates"  response = requests.get(url) data = response.json()  channel_id = data['result'][0]['channel_post']['chat']['id'] print("Channel ID:", channel_id)`
Remember to replace `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"` with your actual bot token.

Choose the method that works best for you to get the Telegram channel ID.
