I've had an ASRock H110 Pro BTC+ in the closest since Ethereum was POW (Proof of Work).

In 2026 GPU mining is long-since no more, but the home server has lived on operating Windows 10 with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) running a lonely SavePoint radio server, offering a sandbox for remote testing.

12gb ram, 100gb SSD, 1TB external HD. i7-7700 CPU. Not much but it has been a reliable second rig.

Times have changed over the years. Hardware and storage costs seem to be at their highest over competition for parts. 100GB might not seem like much, but Windows is a heavy OS (quickly taking up to 40gb of hard drive space).

Windows users often use WSL because much of modern development tooling is built for Linux, while they still want Windows as their main desktop OS. But any WSL user can native Linux can be easier to work with than WSL, and also provides performance benefits.

I wanted to see what was out there and what others were using when it came to the home server space. Something native linux, low OS footprint, and with an active developer (and aftermarket) community.

Along my way to find a replacement I learned about Prox Mox, and its approach to virtual machines and sub linux containers. This article will introduce you to what I was able to learn during the conversion of my home server from Windows to Proxmox.

## Proxmox and the ProxMoxBox box

[Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview) is a Debian-based virtualization platform that manages both VMs and LXC containers behind one web interface. I am running 9.2.2, which sits on Debian 13.

The machine is now, unavoidably, the ProxMoxBox box. Say it three times fast. I will wait.

There is a genuine reason to pick Proxmox beyond the feature list, and it is the ecosystem. Home servers have a large and active community of people solving the same problems, publishing helper scripts, and answering questions from someone running exactly your hardware. That is worth a great deal when something does not work at two in the morning.

## What LXC is, and how it differs from a virtual machine

A container and a virtual machine cost the machine very different amounts, and that decides how many services fit on one box.

A virtual machine emulates a computer. It boots its own kernel, runs its own device drivers through QEMU, and holds its own memory. When you give a VM 4 GB, that 4 GB is allocated to it and the host cannot use it for anything else, whether the VM is busy or idle.

An LXC container shares the host's kernel. There is no guest kernel to boot, no QEMU, no virtio device state. What you get instead is a set of isolated namespaces and cgroup limits around a normal Linux process tree. In practice a bare Debian container idles at something like 30 to 60 MB of RAM before you run anything, where the same services in a VM cost 200 to 400 MB just to exist. A container starts in under a second. A VM takes 15 to 30 seconds to boot.

**Unprivileged** changes the blast radius. An unprivileged container maps its root user to an unprivileged user on the host, so root inside the container is nobody in particular outside it. Both of mine are unprivileged.

Separating the two applications was worth as much to me as the efficiency was. Under the old setup they shared one Linux environment, which meant they shared their dependencies, their failure modes and their fate: whatever took one down was liable to take the other with it. Now each application is its own container, with its own packages, its own resource ceiling and its own restart. The radio can crash without the cameras noticing. Proxmox also snapshots and backs up each container independently, on a schedule, which replaces the previous arrangement of remembering to export the whole thing by hand and usually not doing it.

Here is the part I originally described, incorrectly, as load balancing. Proxmox does not balance load between containers. What actually happens is subtler and more useful: the `cores` setting is a ceiling, not a reservation. I have allocated 10 cores across 8 threads, deliberately overlapping, because each service can burst up to its ceiling whenever the other is idle. Container memory is elastic in the same way, where VM memory is not without ballooning. On top of that, `cpuunits` gives the cameras priority over the radio when both want the CPU at once.

Ceilings rather than reservations is what lets two services share 12 GB without either being starved, which is not what "load balancing" describes.

## Reaching it: Tailscale, and what actually provides the security

Both services stay off the public internet entirely: no forwarded port on my router, no reverse proxy with a certificate facing the world. Everything is reached over [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), running 1.102.2 in both containers.

Tailscale builds a private mesh network between your own devices. Its MagicDNS feature gives each machine a stable hostname on that network, so I reach the radio and the cameras by name rather than by chasing an IP address that changes. Because every connection is initiated outbound from the device, it works perfectly well from behind the NAT described earlier. NAT traversal is a convenience here, not a defence.

I want to be careful about that last point, because it is the sort of thing that gets stated loosely and then repeated. Not exposing a port is real and worthwhile, but obscurity is not the security boundary here. The tailnet access control list is. Only devices I have added to my network can reach these services at all, and the ACL decides which of those devices may reach which service. That is a policy I control and can audit, rather than a hope that nobody scans my address.

On cost: as of the pricing change in April 2026, Tailscale's free Personal plan covers up to 6 users with unlimited devices, which is comfortably more than a household needs. Check the current terms before you rely on that, since it changed once already this year.

There is one container-specific trap worth recording. Tailscale in an unprivileged LXC container needs `/dev/net/tun` passed through explicitly. Containers do not get it by default, and without it the daemon simply cannot build a tunnel. Separately, Debian ships `tailscaled` with `Restart=on-failure`. It exited cleanly once with status 0, systemd counted that as success, and remote access stayed down for three minutes. That is now `Restart=always`.

## Where it stands right now

I am writing this while the migration is still finishing, and I would rather say so than present a tidy retrospective.

The Proxmox host is built. Both containers are built, configured and verified: the cold-start test passed, with Wi-Fi associating on its own, storage mounting, both containers auto-starting and both services answering. What remains is data. The media library is copying to the newly reformatted volume, after which the media paths get repointed, both containers restart, and the radio gets a fresh deploy.

The concrete result, though, is already visible. Both containers running put the host at 2.0 GB used with 9.4 GB available. The same two workloads as virtual machines would have consumed roughly 6 GB before executing a single line of application code. On a 12 GB machine, that difference is the entire reason this approach works.

## The two applications

[SavePoint](https://savepoint.fm) is an online radio management platform with multi-channel streaming to Discord and YouTube. I build it, and I run a hobby station on it called TaverRX that plays role-playing game soundtrack music. Running the station is genuinely how I find the rough edges in the platform, which is a good argument for keeping it alive through a hardware migration rather than letting it stay dark.

The surveillance system is my own code, driving two Google Nest cameras through Google's Smart Device Management API. A bridge process holds and extends the Nest sessions against a quota of 100 queries per hour per camera, which is the sort of constraint that shapes an entire design once you hit it. Support for Ring cameras is planned but not built.

That project is not open source yet. I intend to publish it this year, and I will update this article with a link when it is available.

## What migration is actually good for

A migration is an excellent bug finder, because it forces every assumption into the open. This one surfaced four latent faults in the camera project that had never been triggered: a recorder configured to dial an RTSP port that nothing was listening on, systemd units bound to a service that had been replaced and no longer existed, a restart-limit directive sitting in the wrong section where systemd ignores it entirely, and a hardened unit with no write access to the directory it records footage into.

All four were waiting to be found. None was caused by the move.

If you self-host anything, the question worth asking is whether your services come back on their own after the next power cut, not whether they are running today. Mine did not come back, and that is what started this.
