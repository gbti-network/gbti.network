// A YAML-dated post could not be saved from the WorkBench: "invalid post: publishedAt: Invalid input".
//
// Root cause: `fieldHtml` in gbti-content-editor.mjs rendered a field value with
//   typeof value === 'object' ? JSON.stringify(value) : String(value)
// and a Date IS an object, so an unquoted `publishedAt: 2025-06-23` (which js-yaml parses to a Date) rendered
// into the input as `"2025-06-23T00:00:00.000Z"` INCLUDING the quote characters. Reading that back through
// new Date() gives Invalid Date, and z.coerce.date() rejects it. publishedAt is a preserved HIDDEN field, so
// the author could neither see the bad value nor edit it, and every save of that item failed.
//
// 46 published posts carry an unquoted YAML date. The two that do not are the ones written by the editor
// itself, which quotes them, which is why this was invisible on anything authored after the migration.

// YAML Date. Then that post was edited through the WorkBench, the repaired save path wrote the date back
// QUOTED as '2025-06-23', js-yaml loaded it as a string, and the assertion failed on main.
//
// So the guard for this fix was broken by the fix working, which is about as self-defeating as a test gets.
// A fixture that other people's ordinary content edits can rewrite is not a fixture. The blob below is that
// post's frontmatter as it stood, minus the churn, and nothing outside this file can change it.
