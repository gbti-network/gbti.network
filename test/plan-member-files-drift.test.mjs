// The gating planner `planMemberFiles` is implemented TWICE, deliberately:
//   canonical  client/src/operations.mjs           (the extension + npm CMS host)
//   mirror     src/lib/workbench-client-core.mjs   (the website WorkBench)
// The split is intentional and documented at workbench-client-core.mjs: importing operations.mjs would drag
// fork-mode and fifteen REST clients into the page bundle. This file does NOT reverse that decision; it
// protects it. This is the function that decides which plaintext reaches a PUBLIC repository, so the two
// diverging silently is the failure worth a dedicated guard: publishing the same item from the website would
// commit a different file set than publishing it from the extension.
//
// The four helpers both implementations lean on (splitMemberMarkdown, MEMBER_MARKER, encAssetFor,
// serializeContentFile) are SHARED imports from client/src, so the only divergence surface is the planner body
// itself, and that is exactly what this file drives.
