// sow-228: the extension Admin page gate. `shell.mjs:150` hid the nav LINK behind [data-admin-only] but the page
// itself had no role check, and `admin.html` is directly navigable, so any signed-in member reaching the URL got the
// whole staff surface. We hid the entrance and never locked the door.
//
// The defect was a DISCLOSURE and TRUST defect, not a privilege escalation: every write behind those panels is denied
// server-side by authorizeStaff/authorizeAdmin against the KV mirror, the config rendered is the public house/*.yml,
// and the coupon read is admin-gated so it 403s and renders zeros. A non-admin saw furniture, not data. That is what
// made it survivable, not what made it safe: the next panel added would inherit the hole silently and may not have a
// server check behind it.
//
// TWO invariants, and the STRUCTURAL one is the regression test. A pure-function test alone would be worthless here
// because a brand new function trivially "fails before the fix" by not existing. The structural test fails against the
// PRE-FIX markup, which is the only proof that it tests the fix.
