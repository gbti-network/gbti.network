// sow-166 (2026-08-23): every subscriber's FIRST email is the 90-day WELCOME issue, whenever they join.

// Before this, the 90-day scope was a property of the NEWSLETTER (it applied only while no prior weekly issue
// existed), not of the SUBSCRIBER. Somebody joining in month three got a thin "this week" email as their

// The tests that carry weight here are the ISOLATION ones. A welcome issue holds ninety days of urls, so if it

// "tidied" later, so it is pinned rather than argued.

// THE ISOLATION PROPERTY, and it turned out to be over-determined. Recorded because the first version of

//
// A welcome issue carries ninety days of urls. If it were ever counted as a "prior issue" it would mark a
// quarter of the catalogue as already-mailed and gut the next weekly. TWO independent mechanisms in
// listPriorIssueIds prevent that, and it matters that they are separate:
//
//   1. The `weekly-` prefix filter, which is the intentional control.
//   2. An accident of string ordering. The guard skips any id where `id >= currentIssueId`, and "welcome-"
//      sorts AFTER "weekly-" (they share "we", then 'l' beats 'e'), so a welcome id is skipped for EVERY
//      weekly compile whatever its date.
//
// Because (2) alone is sufficient on the real code path, a test that only exercises that path cannot tell
// whether (1) still works. So the filter is pinned separately below, on the one call shape where the ordering
// guard does not apply. Do not merge these two tests back together.
