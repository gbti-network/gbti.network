// sow-106 follow-up: ROUTE-SET PARITY between the two API routers, the extension host
// (extension/src/ext-dispatch.mjs, which routes with `case '/api/x'`) and the website/npm host
// (client/src/api.mjs, which routes with `if (pathname === '/api/x')`). This bug class has produced four live
// defects, each because a route existed in one router and not the other and nothing compared them: Unpublish/
// Republish (/api/content/status), comment delete (/api/comment/delete), and image staging (/api/image).
//
// The extraction is the load-bearing part. A naive per-syntax regex (match only `case '...'`, or only
// `pathname === '...'`) reports dozens of false "missing" routes because each file uses ONLY its own syntax,
// which is the trap that produced a 56-false-positive parity run during this SOW. Instead we extract every
// '/api/...' STRING LITERAL from BOTH files: both routers name the route as the same literal, so this catches
// both syntaxes and matches the real route count (68 each at the time of writing).
//
// The allowlist is the point of the guard, not an afterthought: an intentional host asymmetry MUST be written
// down here WITH a reason, or the guard turns the next silent divergence into a red build.
//
// TRANSITIONAL (sow-204, sequenced with sow-200): the "route parity" test below is valid ONLY while the two
// hosts are meant to match. sow-204 deliberately makes authoring website-only and removes ~27 authoring routes
// from the extension, so parity STOPS being the invariant. When that lands, this diff test must be reshaped
// into a host-responsibility MANIFEST (a declared per-host route set with a reason for each, rather than a
// symmetry check with a 27-entry allowlist, which would assert nothing). Do that reshape in sow-204's plan
// mode with the owner; do NOT read the parity assertion here as a permanent contract. The SECOND test in this
// file, the pre-auth positioning invariant, is NOT transitional: it is the removal-safety guardrail that must
// keep holding as routes are deleted, because ext-dispatch encodes authorization by position.
