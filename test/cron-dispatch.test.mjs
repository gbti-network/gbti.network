// The Worker's cron dispatch. Three schedules are configured; the routing used to be a ternary chain whose

// drain". This pins that an unrecognised schedule runs NOTHING.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN A TIDINESS FIX. The next cron string anyone adds is the SOW-166 weekly digest, and
// a catch-all is at its worst exactly there: the digest would appear to do nothing while an unscheduled
// syndication drain posted to live channels in its place. That presents as "the digest is broken" rather than
// as a misroute, so the real fault is the last thing anyone would look for.
