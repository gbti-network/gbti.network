// sow-166 / sow-157: the runner that creates the Stripe Customers for the recovered legacy members.
//
// THESE TESTS EXIST BECAUSE THE AUTHOR COULD NOT RUN THE SCRIPT. Executing it needs a LIVE Stripe key with
// Customers read and write, and the session permission classifier refuses to run a script with that key in
// its environment, which is a correct boundary for a live billing mutation. So the parts that can be driven
// without a key are driven here rather than being asserted by reading, and the untested edge is named in the
// commit rather than left implied.
//
// The load-bearing one is findExistingCustomers. It decides who does NOT get a Customer created, so a lookup
// error that degrades into "no customer found" would double-create for every member who already has one, and
// the two cases are the same shape at the call site.
