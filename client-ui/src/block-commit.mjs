// sow-235: committing an edited block from the WorkBench Preview back into the Markdown source.
//
// The Preview renders the body with renderMarkdownWithBlocks (client/src/markdown.mjs), which stamps every emitted
// block with a data-blk index and records that block's SOURCE line range. Editing happens in the rendered DOM, so
// the commit has to turn a block of HTML back into the right number of Markdown lines.
//
// The naive version replaced a block's whole range with ONE line, which is why only single-line paragraphs and
// headings were ever editable: a two-item list would have collapsed to a single bullet and a fenced code block
// would have lost its fences. It also could not have worked, because the rendered HTML does not carry everything
// the Markdown does. A table's column alignment survives only as a style attribute, a fence's language only as a
// class, and a list's ordered-ness only as the tag name.
//
// So the block is rebuilt from its OWN SOURCE rather than from the DOM: re-parse the original range with
// parseBlocks, replace only the text-bearing fields with what the author edited, and re-serialize. Everything the
// DOM cannot express is carried through untouched because it never left the source. parseBlocks/serializeBlocks
// are the doc editor's existing model, reused rather than reimplemented.
