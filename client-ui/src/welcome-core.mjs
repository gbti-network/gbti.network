/**
 * sow-207 QA: the step a RETURNING member should land on, given a per-step "is this already done" flag list.
 *
 * The wizard used to open at step 0 every time, so a refresh (or following the "Skip for now" link and coming
 * back) sent a member who had already connected Discord, followed channels and members, and picked topics all
 * the way back to "Connect Discord" with the rail's checkmarks cleared. None of their work was lost, since all
 * of it persists server-side, but the wizard could not see what it had already achieved.
 *
 * DERIVED, NOT A SAVED CURSOR. The flags come from real state (the Discord link, the followed channels, the
 * saved socials, the follow graph, the stored topic prefs), so a member who did some of this SOMEWHERE ELSE
 * gets credit for it: linking Discord from the extension, or following people from their profile pages, both
 * count here. A persisted step number would instead replay a stale position and re-ask for work already done.
 *
 * Returns the FIRST incomplete step. When everything is complete it returns the LAST step rather than a
 * done-state, deliberately: the done card is a place you arrive by pressing "I am all set", and auto-jumping
 * a returning member straight to it would hide the wizard they came back to use. Landing them on the final
 * step lets them keep adjusting and finish on their own action.
